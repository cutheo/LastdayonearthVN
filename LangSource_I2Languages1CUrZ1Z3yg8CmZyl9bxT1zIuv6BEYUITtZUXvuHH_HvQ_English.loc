- 我们增加了一个用斧头打破家具的机会，这样就没有什么东西可以阻挡你前往他人的箱子。但要小心，这对在制作时由其他物品制成的家具不适用。  
入侵者有新的任务，这意味着你可以尝试用其他的方法来赢得他们的善意，例如制作一套战术铠甲或杀死15个讨厌的毒药僵尸。 

炮塔 
- 我们改变了炮塔配方，现在你可以使用它防御你的房屋。 
- 请注意，炮塔只会射击温血目标，不会射击僵尸。 
- 炮塔可以升级。请在地堡中寻找特殊部件来进行升级操作。如果炮塔被毁坏，你可以用这些零件修理它。  
- 你可以修建多达 4 个炮塔，它们都以汽油作为动力。  

新的地点
- 现在游戏中有一个临时的橡树地点，在那里你不仅能找到资源，还能参加有趣的活动：迎接入侵者、野生动物和伐木工！ 
- 阿尔法地堡的电力供应几乎修复了，发电机有足够的电力能让电梯下到第四层。寻找有用的物品和炮塔零件吧，但要小心：新的陷阱不会白白等待。

你不能用多功能工具攻击其他玩家——你的盔甲里有一个特殊的芯片可以防止这种行为。
不要尝试把多功能工具拿进你的基地——没有你的装甲服，它是无法使用的。

平衡性与功能性
便携式工作台现在有了新的配方。你甚至可以拆解螺栓、轴承、电线等微小部件。
建造一个狗箱现在更容易——我们已经减少了组装这个组合的花费。

游戏中有新地点——旧农场。该位置始终在地图上，并每隔几天就会更新。要到达农场，你必须在受感染的溪流上架起一座桥。别担心，你不需要任何用电子线路的车削机械。木板、金属和一些非常简单的东西就足够了。

\n\n<b>新的僵尸和头目<b>\n
老牌的入侵者将会在乡村舞会上与你作伴，还有新的敌人：受感染的牛、农民僵尸和他们的头领——蹂躏者。做好准备，舞会上会有一场恶战。 

\n\n<b>新的奖励<b>\n
进入树林越远，奖励就越有吸引力。漫步在新的位置时，确保你找到一个上着重锁的特殊盒子——里面藏着一些有趣的东西。你得在那里用工作台切开锁，别把它带回家！  

\n\n<b>油箱<b>\n

传说入侵者找到了一个废弃的警察局，计划拿走里面的所有武器。准备好进行新冒险了吗？这个活动将对所有玩家提供，无论其等级和车辆是什么。  


新敌人。 
你要与新种类的僵尸战斗。它们不仅样子不同，活动机制也不同。拿着盾牌的装甲僵尸可以承受最强玩家的攻击，而某些警官僵尸可在攻击玩家时治疗自己。还要小心来自特种部门的僵尸，它们会在生命值低的时候爆炸。 

新的资源和奖励 
消灭一波波的僵尸会让你获得卡片，卡片分为 4 个级别：警士、警长、警督，以及警监。与入侵者交易，获得最高级别的卡片，用它们换取贵重资源。

If you happen to end up in a situation like mine - being all alone in the devastated world submerged in chaos - read my diary. Hopefully, it will help you survive…  
First of all, build a house. Homeless don’t live long here.[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_2=I have always traveled a lot and I’m safe to say that a fair knowledge of the terrain is one of the main requirements essential for survival. 
Explore the environment, keep a couple of first aid kits to hand. Learn everything new. 
All skills are useful. Build a melting furnace. You will need it for work with metals.[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_3=The dead will return, so don’t bother to mop up the territory once and for all. Just keep killing them again and again. 
Be practical - stock items of different kinds in separate chests, so that you can quickly find what you need at the right time.[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_4=Bunkers are packed with all sorts of stuff. Too much to take all of it out per run. Go deeper to find something genuinely valuable. Take a backup weapon, and most importantly, armor. 
Jeff died in a bunker a few days ago. I found him on the third floor. He was killed by a turret for defending…[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_5=Get a dog for a pet. Or better yet, - a few dogs. I used to have a dog named Troy. He died after attacking a toxic abomination following me. The poison must have got into his system. That was not the first time he was saving my life. Good boy.[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_6=Reinforce wooden walls as soon as possible, as they won’t stand a zombie HORDE. It will also make it harder for other survivors to invade your place. 
Remember, your house is your fortress, you have to protect it.[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_7=Assemble a radio to get in touch with the locals. The first to answer is most likely to be dealer Joe. Tell him you’re from Carlos. He is a nice fellow, though a little greedy. 
Also try to get in touch with the guys that mop up the bunker Alfa. They may even take you on a raid with them. But I doubt that will happen.
[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_8=Go to the places you've already been to. Visit the spots that are easiest to get to. For example, the closest to the base. It’s easier to navigate the familiar terrain and survive on it. 
Today I found a Chopper wheel in Limestone Cliffs. Now all I need to find is a gas tank…[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_9=There is Crooked Creek Farm not far from here. Another place full of useful stuff to collect. The Kennetts used to live there, god bless their souls. Now there are only the dead.
P.S.: Last time I was there the bridge to the farm was completely destroyed… probably, it’ll have to get fixed.
[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_10=I ran into someone’s shelter. You may run into similar ones as well, so better carry axes around. 
Assessing the situation during a raid is very important. If you smash everything in sight - zombies will rush to the noise, or what is worse, the owners of the shelter.[i2t]premium_battle_pass_note_11=Set up traps. Even simple spike traps will do for the start. Don’t neglect your own safety and skimp on building resources.

DAY OF THE DEAD (26.10 - 07.11)

This year we celebrate the Day of the Dead as well. This day cemeteries are full of flowers and offerings, people dress up as the dead and souls of the deceased come back to visit their relatives and loved ones. You are to meet La Catrina and help lost souls to find their way back home.    

FATHER JAUD CULT (24.10 - 07.11)

Rumor has it that Father Jaud cult’s signs have been spotted again in the west. There are many legends about the rituals. Some people say that he believed in Great Repose while others blame him for summoning the witch. His personal diary will help you find out if the legends are true.

游戏中有新地点，称为“加油站”。在那里，你将能够找到备件，它们有助于你获得新的摩托车模型并进行升级。该地点具有标准的冷却时间：2 天一次。机械工简主管本地的西海岸海关办事处。你将因为帮忙送货和整理资源而获得不错的报酬：简发送了大量宝贵的资源，她会用一个装满有趣东西的盒子来感谢你。例如新的摩托车方案或修理包蓝图，取决于你的幸运程度。
车库
现在你可以建造一个车库，像一个真正的车手一样度过你的夜晚。为什么想要它？因为它可以让你重漆、清洗、修理摩托车，最重要的是，学习新的摩托车模型。所有这一切都需要清理新的位置并与可爱的简交朋友。我们强烈建议你在靠近出口的地方建造车库，以免开车出来时遇到困难。
摩托车 2.0。
骑上你的摩托车，撞击每一个生物或碾过每一个僵尸。骑车会消耗汽油，撞击物品会对摩托车造成损害。你可以在车库中修理它，也可以在路上使用修理包。并非所有地点都适合骑行。你不能在诸如地堡和农场等地点骑上摩托车。
新的摩托车模型
现有 3 种新型摩托车可供选择：越野摩托车、军用摩托车和警用摩托车。你可以从机械工那里获得第一种类型的蓝图，在 Alfa 地堡找到第二种蓝图，在警察局的 99 波僵尸那里得到警用摩托车的蓝图。新型摩托车的耐久度、速度、油箱容量、负荷和燃料消耗都不同。[i2t]ui_new_bike_mod_available=Upgrade bike in garage[i2t]shop_backpacks_pack_name=Military backpacks[i2t]shop_shop_backpack_1=Peacekeeper's backpack[i2t]shop_shop_backpack_2=Military engineer's backpack[i2t]shop_shop_backpack_3=Scout's backpack[i2t]shop_backpacks_banner_description=Great backpacks stuffed with various loot.[i2t]shop_backpacks_pack_description=Loot-filled backpacks right from the military base.

根本性的变化将影响每一位存活者：角色升级系统已经彻底改革：\n
– 探索经验值已被移除：现在，每达到一个等级，你就可以选择一项技能。选择你认为最需要的技能，并以自己觉得舒适的方式培养你的人物。\n
– 你可以把你吃灰的 99 级捡起来了——等级上限增加到了 200。\n\n
<b>技能更新</b>\n
摩托车驾驶技能、全地形车司机技能、寒冷生存、专注和伪装大师技能也被无情地删除了。它们被新的技能所取代，例如“步伐如风”，它可以让你在潜行模式下更快地移动，或者“严格饮食”，它能减缓饥饿。\n\n
<b>经验丰富的玩家的改变</b>\n
– 你的主动技能和通过流血流汗获得的最稀有技能会保留，但并不是所有的技能都会被转移到新的系统。根据你的等级，你会收到积分来升级你在新系统里的技能。这意味着如果你是 99 级，但没有很多技能的话，你也会得到 98 个技能点。
 – 曾经拥有<b>大量</b>技能，并因此失去了其中一部分技能的存活者们，请不要难过，我们已经向你的收件箱发送了礼物作为补偿。[i2t]tutorial_caption_go_to_chest=Loot

I have seen cars like that in the forest, but those were all rusty. Find 2 engines in those wrecks.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_17=In life sergeant Kowalski was disliked by everyone except perhaps his partner. Find that couple in Pine Bushes and put them to rest.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_18=They say you're a good hunter? A zombie beast latched onto a pack of wolves in one of the Pine Groves. Track down and kill the Alpha Wolf until it leaves us without the rest of the living things. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_19=Do you know what I hate about these zombies? They spit out some crap! One of that kind is walking around Limestone Ridges. We call him the Deadface. Kill that thing for me.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_20=Up to kill some zombies? Timmy the Bloat is hanging about Limestone Cliffs, he is the one to be killed. By the way, the Bloat is not just a fancy nickname. Don't dirty up with his guts.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_21=The Colonel used to push his platoon like the devil himself. Now he lies in wait for survivors in Pine Woods. String yourself up and go rid our world from that tyrant.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_22=Fifty-Two-Mike always carries his shield around. No one knows how to approach him. He walks somewhere in Limestone Spires, try to spot and kill him.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_23=If you have a true friend, you can always take him with you on a quest. Raise 3 puppies into adult dogs. Don't forget to feed them! They eat a hell of a lot. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_24=There is an important task. Run around and search for lost puppies. I can't stand it when they're freezing out there somewhere. Three will be enough.  [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_27=I used to like watching bull races, but current rodeo couldn't apear even in the old cowboys' worst nightmares. Kill 3 zombie bulls at the farm, it'll be fun. At least to me.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_28=How long ago have you been at the farm? You know that former owners hid there a blue chest with valuable loot. Go there and crack it open, it's stuffed with nice things.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_29=You know without whom the world will be better? Without that filthy zombie at the old farm, Ravager. Do me a favor - shut him up at last.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_30=I've been looking for someone to dispose of that bloody Witch from the Infected Forest. Can you cope with it? Take C-4 with you, might come in handy.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_31=I know how to test you. Go to the farm and kill 5 Savage Giants. Who knows, maybe someday we'll kill all zombies. But who am I kidding...[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_32=I heard you slash the dead left and right. I'd like to see if you're really that good. If you stand 20 zombie waves at the police station, then I'll believe it. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_33=Firearms of any kind is our best friend. When you're at your base, disassemble 3 guns on the recycler. If you're lucky, you will be able to get valuable parts to improve any other gun.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_34=I want to know for sure that you mean business. Find at least one C4. Don't be afraid, you'll keep it. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_16_done=You can find a nice engine in old cars. Get such engine home and disassemble it if you have a motorcycle. Steel would never hurt. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_17_done=I think it was too easy for you. I could kill Kowalski with my bare hands. Just don't want to get dirty. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_18_done=Has this wolf snatched you? Be careful, fresh blood attracts the dead. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_19_done=I suppose finding The Deadface was easier than killing him. Nasty guy, isn't he?[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_20_done=Hey, is that a piece of Timmy on your shoulder? Be careful. Who knows what made him mutate like that.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_21_done=The Colonel is very slow but if he catches you, there'll be hell to pay. I think I should have warned you earlier. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_22_done=Hey, Mike made you dance? I'd like to have such shield for myself, nice stuff.  [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_23_done=What can be better than a dog? Only three dogs! If you're lucky and a smart dog will grow up, you'll be able to take it with you. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_24_done=And the most difficult part - feed the pack of dogs. Turkeys last a long time, you should try. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_27_done=I can't believe you made it. Used a lot of ammo? These bulls have thick skin, you gotta have a more powerful weapon. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_28_done=Managed to cut the lock? Yeah, it's not that easy, but the loot is worth it. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_29_done=Well, a problem less. Sometimes we send our guys to the farm, now it will be easier to take stuff out for them. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_30_done=This Witch is hot, isn't she? I can't even imagined what she looked like when she was alive. And I don't wanna imagine.[i2t]ui_quests_raiders_31_done=Minus five problems. You are doing great with these huge zombies![i2t]ui_quests_raiders_32_done=Can you really do this task as well? You are one of the best shooters I know, I'm serious. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_33_done=Disassembled weapons but didn't get the parts you need? Try to disassemble undamaged weapons, the chances to find a part you need are higher. [i2t]ui_quests_raiders_34_done=See you're determined. Know where the detonator is put?[i2t]inventory_stack_view_grenade_name=Grenade[i2t]inventory_stack_view_grenade_description=Powerful and effective weapon in skillful hands. Throw with caution

当时，科学家和军方进行了许多实验。他们中的一部分人认为，地下避难所也许能帮助他们在地球末日中生存下来。
有些地下室还住着人，有些则被僵尸占领了，这些年来地下室就在你眼皮底下，你却没察觉。
要找到它们，你必须仔细探索基础资源的地点。秘密入口可能位于最意想不到的地方。 
共有 5 座地下室。每一座都藏有战利品和居民。当你死后，你将失去一切，并且无法返回地下室。祝你好运！

There are still 11 of us, including myself. One is wounded, and by tomorrow, there are likely to be 10 left. I heard Naomi asking not to waste bandages on that guy. He passed away at night.[i2t]season_01_note_02_text=344. His name was Joshua or just Joshy. He was a good pal and, if he'd waken up, he would've told you that my name is not Darren. 
Last time we went hunting, we came under fire. Phelps got shot in his shoulder, and Joshua right in the backbone. I have a hunch that the headquarter decided to downsize the group.[i2t]season_01_note_03_text=Day 74. Naomi gathered us and said that there is a tanker drifting nearby that we can make our own. All we need is to get onboard, and she seems to have a plan on how to do it. We just have to wait for the tide to come in.
The info about the group has been updated. I consider the task completed since the ultimate goal of raiders has become known.[i2t]season_01_note_04_text=233. BR. I suspect that's not just a simple tanker. Those "from above" are definitely up to something. Mission statements are too vague.
It's not clear yet what the headquarter wants. Maybe the tanker has oil or weapons. After all, the tanker itself. Naomi wants to get it. Why can't anyone else want it, too?[i2t]season_01_note_05_text=Day 75. When the tanker was a few miles off the coast, we saw someone standing on the top deck. They were looking at us from afar. It turned out that Naomi knew the people onboard.
Their leader's name is Troy Weiss, he calls their tanker the Ark, and the people on it - the Awaiters.[i2t]season_01_note_06_text=They look like another lunatic fringe. Naomi managed to get their leader talk. His words were mainly nonsense: that his people are going through a test - they're waiting. Whatever it means.
I'm requesting to update the task considering the people found on the object. In the coming days, we'll probably try to take over the ship.[i2t]season_01_note_07_text=901. D. I stole the walkie talkie from Naomi.
Checked in with the jerks from the headquarter. They were mumbling and had nothing to say except for "Keep yourself undercover" - what kind of statement is that, idiots?
Damn it. Reached out for the people on the tanker to warn them about the assult. I don't know if it was Weiss who was answering me, but he ended our talk with "I know about everything".[i2t]season_01_note_08_text=Day 76. Last night I stole Naomi's walkie talkie and everything went great. I checked in with the headquarter to update the statement. Keep staying undercover, as usually.
I'm no specialist, but the tanker seems to be speeding up and approaching too fast. Even Phelps, who never pays attention to the ship, noticed that.[i2t]season_01_note_09_text=The people on the tanker gathered together at the command bridge. It's hard to say how many of them there are, but Naomi assures that there are few. They seem to be unarmed.
Phelps had bloody nose, and I walked him to a tent.[i2t]season_01_note_10_text=I didn't report about this to the headquarter, but inside the tent Phelps suddenly said, "I'm waiting. He has a fever".
I heard something like that from those sectarians or whoever they are. That shit really creeps me out.  [i2t]season_01_note_11_text=Day 77. The tanker stands a mile off the bank. No one is seen aboard. Naomi and a couple of others are discussing the plan of assault.
Phelps has been sleeping since yesterday. He talks deliriously from time to time. He says that we're almost there. The waiting shouldn't be long.[i2t]season_01_note_12_text=A few guys were discussing something in my tent. Seems like they are planning to get out of here, but keeping it a secret.
At lunch, Naomi first started talking about a new home we may acquire, again there were those brainwashing phases, but at that moment blood streamed out of her nose. I took her walkie talkie away. [i2t]season_01_note_13_text=We laid Naomi down in Phelps' tent. Everyone who saw that wants to get away from the ship. Some are already packing their stuff which is not theirs.
My body feels oddly weak. Requesting evacuation. Waiting.[i2t]season_01_note_14_text=B1.1. I haven't slept for four goddamn days. All these spy games and notes have turned into nonsense. But what is it all worth?
Naomi got off the bed and took my Glock. She asked me, "Who are we waiting for - Darren or Rob?", then shot herself in the head.[i2t]season_01_note_15_text=Day 78. Conspiracy is pointless. Everyone in the camp is dead. An odd chemical smell is felt eveyrwhere. I'm sick.
I'm sitting in the tent, with the bodies of Phelps and Naomi inside. There are voices heard nearby. I've got only my Glock by my side.[i2t]season_01_note_16_text=I woke up. Can't figure it out if it's day or night. I can hardly move. I lift my hands up and my breathing gets laboured. Can't write too much.
Feels like time has stopped. There is a voice from afar. Or is that a helicopter? Damn, where are you, jerks? Why's nobody answering.[i2t]season_01_note_17_text=A tall man came into the tent. That was Weiss, I knew that straightaway. There was his little dog with him. Weiss said that we all had been waiting for the one they brought on the Ark. He said that, and I wrote down, "We've been waiting for you".
He stuck a syringe into a capsule and asked if I wanted to be waiting together with them. I don't remember what I answered.[i2t]season_01_note_18_text=Day 79, not sure though. I woke up feeling awful. The bodies of Phelps and Naomi are there in their place. Weiss must have left. Did he come to the tanker? His dog's still here. There's no sign of the people from the ship.
I got out to the shore, no one's out here. The dog brought me a stick twice the size bigger than it.[i2t]season_01_note_19_text=The tanker looks dead. There's no one onboard. It looks teriffying, shocking, and thrilling. But it shouldn't be a joke to you, guys.
Nels, Jimm, whoever's team is going to reconstruct the chronology... If there will be any... Send my thanks for the timely evacuation.[i2t]season_01_note_20_text=D5. Please, don't look for me if you want to know about all that or find answers - I've already told you everything I had. If I didn't stop in time, you wouldn't know anything from me.
Hopefully, Spike won't be a burden for you. He's loud and messy, but pretty friendly.[i2t]new_event_available_dialog_caption=New event available[i2t]new_event_available_dialog_description=Go to the global map to see the new event.[i2t]bike_skin_collection_dialog_button_claim=Claim[i2t]season_battle_pass_started=Season started![i2t]shop_pack_season_01_premium_pack_name=Premium access to Season 1[i2t]patchnotes_14_1=[i2fb]第 1 季

They had access to the computer in the lab and used to lick colonel Hendrix's boots. Although Barker believes it was Salt. Not sure about that, though, I suppose, these are 50:50 gueses.[i2t]season_1_5_cellar_02_journal_note_02=There were complications during the transplantation. The two current problems are the lack of facilities (!) and condition of the subject's stem cells. I'm afraid my qualification is not enough to complete the work successfully. Jim, I quit. You should understand. I'm sorry.[i2t]season_1_5_cellar_01_journal_note_caption=From Frederick Olsen's notes[i2t]season_1_5_cellar_01_journal_note_01=The commission, convened by Jales to investigate the incident with object 2L2Z4, shut Barker down. This time he stayed quiet. Honestly, his silence confused me even more than the arguments he usually started.[i2t]season_1_5_cellar_03_journal_note_caption=Personal notes[i2t]season_1_5_cellar_03_journal_note_01=They wonder whether I am a psycho. Salt certainly thinks I'm not. Others said I need some rest. I have an obsession. I've lost control over myself and the situation. But what does it change, anyway? [i2t]season_1_5_cellar_03_journal_note_02=We've turned this world into hell, what could be worse? But Charlie... it's our chance to do everything right this time. I won't let their fears take the last chance away from the mankind. It's sad that too few of them got it right.[i2t]season_1_5_cellar_03_journal_note_03=I can't let misfortunes mislead us from the only right way. Only through becoming like Charlie, can we save ourselves. And I don't care if I'm considered a psycho and no matter the cost I will pay. It's time to get things right. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_01=The locals say that they saw soldiers in a forest not far from the Wall. It’s not clear how many of them there are, but it seems there are scientists in the group as well. Something really weird is going on and I have to figure it out. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_01=Set out to the camp[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_02=The soldiers turned out to be deserters but not simple ones. They got into a beef with the HQ and eventually they left. I don’t know the reasons. Their leader is some Barker. He’s a good man but weird. He’s assembling some stuff and says it will help destroy cocoons. And he needs my help. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_02=Fix a workbench in the camp [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_03=Barker said that his people and he had left the HQ to keep on researching the object “Charlie”. He said that some colonel Hendrix had ordered to stop the work although it was almost finished. Barker suspects that Hendrix has personal matters. He may want to finish the research himself. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_03=Speak to Barker[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_04=Barker sent me to one of the labs that Hendrix had ordered to close down. It isn’t hard to figure out that there was no closing-down. Instead of that, Barker’s people kept on researching the cells but it’s been two days there is no connection with them. They may have had guests from the HQ. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_04=Find soldiers at the first base[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_05=Something terrible has happened in the lab. The tracks are like those of a wave of the dead but what are they doing here? Barker’s guys managed to fight back but some of them died. They say that Salt, a bioengineer, might have barricaded in one of the rooms, he is responsible for the research. I have to get him out and find out what has happened…[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_05=Find Salt[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_06=Salt said that when they came, everyone had been already dead. He managed to find out that the preventive gateway was damaged, that’s why particles from Charlie’s corpse had got into the outside environment. This attracted the dead. They must have instinctively thought that there was a cocoon here. I’ll try to clean up here. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_06=Clean up the base basement[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_07=This beast turned out to be extremely creepy. It might be one experimental objects with transplanted stem cells. It seems that there was a whole range of experiments here. I have to tell Barker about that when I come back to the camp. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_07=Speak to Barker[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_08=When I came back to the camp, Salt was dead. Barker had thought he was a traitor and killed him. But I’m sure Salt knew more than he managed to tell. It turns out only those lab workers that set off to get infected tissue samples are alive. And Barker wants me to get them back to the camp. Damn I don’t like all of this. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_08=Find scientists in the infected zone[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_09=Seems Barker is hiding something. He didn’t tell me that his people had run away. I think one of the lab workers realized that the experiments with Charlie’s cells would come to no good. In that case, I think I’m going to pretend that I trust him. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_09=Speak to Barker[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_10=According to Barker, Salt managed to inform the HQ on our location. This means that four agents must be already on their way. I think they might try to get to a good position and go through the pine grove or wood. I have to intercept them… and try to eliminate. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_10=Find four agents in the woods[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_11=All four of them were armed well. Seems the HQ decided to mop up and eliminate the deserters and all those involved in this circus. Damn, I feel sorry for those guys, they are just pawns in this game…Time to go back to Barker. I have to be careful, act like I don’t suspect anything. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_11=Speak to Barker[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_12=Barker sent me to the second laboratory. Actually, he sent me to clean up but in practice I can act based on the situation. Barker doesn’t want the HQ to learn the results of his experiments. That means that the results are bad or there are no results at all. I’ll find that when I get there. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_12=Get in the lab at the second base and clean it up[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_13=Saw some reports. During the experiment, Barker was trying to research stem cells of the object 2L-2Z4 or “Charlie”. He was interested in their potential of transplantation into a living host. TRANSPLANTATION INTO A LIVING HOST. What the hell?! Time for a serious talk. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_13=Go back to the camp to Barker[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_14=What is he playing at? Pretends he hasn’t noticed anything. Speaks to me as if we were friends but he has his weapon ready. I have to protect the camp. There are many good guys here, I’ll help them in the first place. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_14=Protect the camp[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_15=Many have left the camp, some died. They had just relied on Barker. He had convinced all these people that the stem cells from the researches could be used as a panacea, a cure for death. And now, there are two of us. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_15=Speak to Barker[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_16=I thought Barker started getting paranoid but he keeps telling me that there’s one more laboratory. They equipped it in the basement of an old house where they had arranged a shelter. Barker told me that we should meet there. I don’t think that’s a good idea. But I have no choice.  [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_16=Clean up the territory and fix the ventilation system[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_17=The way down is clear, I gotta go down. It seems like a trap to me. I can feel Barker looking at my back. Well…that’s where it all started, seems it has to end here, as well. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_17=Go down to the laboratory[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_18=Deep down, I knew that this was going to end this way. Barker seemed too devoted to his work, in a fanatical way. I didn’t spot him for a psycho right away. Psycho willing to breed a new human race with a bone marrow from the dead. What the hell… I have to put an end to all this shit. [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_18=Kill Barker[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_19=Rest in peace, Colonel Barker. Rest in peace, Salt, rest in peace, all those guys I knew that died in this pointless outbreak of hatred between those trying to survive. Today I will destroy the cocoon and finish this.  [i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_task_19=Destroy the main cocoon[i2t]season_1_5_quest_note_20=Barker is dead. Didn’t think I’d miss him. He seemed weird from the beginning, I always suspected something, but now I think I get it. He did care about our future. Unlike those sitting on their asses in the HQ, Barker was with people. And he was dreaming to become the savior of all, and his dream turned into something ugly. His name was Sam.

秘密的军事实验带来了麻烦，但我们却从未吸取历史教训。军方决定在查理身上进行一些实验。结果出事了，而且事态脱离了他们的控制。与巴克上校的会面将让情况更明朗。
活动“感染区”
军事实验的后果已经显现出来。消灭所有茧和污染僵尸。
活动“存活者营地”
一群存活者处于严重危险之中。要改变力量的平衡，使其有利于好人一方，就全靠你了。
全新僵尸
实验引起的变异已经迅速扩散开来。新的敌人很快就会来，但久经考验的子弹和刀枪仍然是解决烦人僵尸的好方法。 
全新头目
主要危险来自那些家伙。打倒他们需要一段时间。但凭借诀窍和机智，这是可以做到的。这一次你会知道，怪物不一定是吓人的变异生物。 
鱼叉
武器永远不嫌多。人们已经使用鱼叉数千年了。所以无需质疑它的可靠性。现在，原始的力量掌握在你手中。
凯芙拉护甲
甚至能够对抗新威胁的强大好东西。轻盈、坚固、可靠的护甲会在面对任何敌人时的生存机会，无论对手是僵尸还是人类。

Aim for the impossible, right?[i2t]building_event_level_18_special_quest_message=Well, hunger is said to be the best spice, huh? I bet all of us are hungry. Can you get some food? [i2t]building_event_level_18_special_quest_complete_message=This food will be enough for some time, but soon we'll be completely screwed. It's a good thing we'll win soon, huh?[i2t]building_event_level_19_special_quest_message=We have chickenfeed of supplies. But we manage to solve the water problem. There's a water tower at the base. Will you look at it?[i2t]building_event_level_19_special_quest_complete_message=I've never thought that people can be that happy to have common water. Your kindness knows no bounds. [i2t]building_event_level_20_special_quest_message=We won't be able to stop another wave. I'll gather the guys and we're leaving for good. Try to keep zombies as long as you can. [i2t]building_event_level_20_special_quest_complete_message=I found a raider when I was getting back to the base. Seems he got shot by his own friends. Trust but verify, huh?[i2t]building_event_level_21_special_quest_message=Noone wants to stay aside. Why throw punches when the fight is over? But it'd be nice if everyone had weapon. Can you find some? [i2t]building_event_level_21_special_quest_complete_message=Our guys are getting worried about a raider among us who's like a viper in our bosom, you know. But we won’t be better than them if we leave him, right?[i2t]building_event_level_22_special_quest_message=Soldiers are wrapping up their swamp operation and retreating. Better late than never. They need fortifications to cover their retreat.[i2t]building_event_level_22_special_quest_complete_message=I hope one day they’ll realize what they’ve done. But an after wit is everyone’s wit, huh? [i2t]building_event_level_23_special_quest_message=There are some huge monsters among the horde zombies. We have to hold them at any cost. Feel the fear but do it anyway, right? [i2t]building_event_level_23_special_quest_complete_message=Monsters...that’s putting it mildly. Just imagine them passing through us. [i2t]building_event_level_24_special_quest_message=This car’s not working again. I would've write it off long ago. But the heart wants what it wants. Hope, you'll find the required parts. [i2t]building_event_level_24_special_quest_complete_message=I may be wrong, but who doesn't like driving fast, huh? It's so good you've fixed it. [i2t]building_event_level_25_special_quest_message=There's never a new fashion but it's old, right? We are running out of food and medicines. And we won't manage without you again. [i2t]building_event_level_25_special_quest_complete_message=It warms your heart when you've got everything you need at hand. And all the rest value this as well. [i2t]building_event_level_26_special_quest_message=Bill says some huge monster from the swamps attacked his friends. Yeah, they're raiders, but swamp beasts are something we need to deal with. [i2t]building_event_level_26_special_quest_complete_message=They all dead? Everyone gets what they deserve, huh? But I don't know who deserves such death. [i2t]building_event_level_27_special_quest_message=The horde is coming here again. We are stuck whichever way we turn. I hope someday it ends. Until then do what you have to.[i2t]building_event_level_27_special_quest_complete_message=Thank you, now catch your breath. It'll take us a while to put this place back in order.[i2t]building_event_level_28_special_quest_message=Many of us can't sleep at night while a former raider is near. I believe you can solve this conflict, people will listen to you.[i2t]building_event_level_28_special_quest_complete_message=It's great that people listened to you. And now it's time to leave disagreements in the past. The remains of the horde are coming. [i2t]building_event_level_29_special_quest_message=Thanks to our friend Bill, many of us know how to hold a rifle in our hands. All we need now is to find a weapon for each of us.[i2t]building_event_level_29_special_quest_complete_message=Thank you. We're taking up defense, and all that's left is to pray for fortune to be at her kindest this time as well.[i2t]building_event_level_30_special_quest_message=We've been preparing for this for a long time, and now the time has come. Let's beat the hell out of them, right?[i2t]building_event_level_30_special_quest_complete_message=New life ahead! We can beat these beasts up every single day! Come tomorrow if you wanna defeat them again. [i2t]building_event_quest_clearing_message=There's a lot of junk in the camp.
Sort it, and maybe you'll find something useful for yourself.[i2t]building_event_quest_construction_message=The defense of the camp is far from great.
Build new reinforcements to slow down the offensives of the Horde.[i2t]building_event_quest_food_message=We've already forgotten the taste of normal food. Can you find food and bring it to the camp?[i2t]building_event_quest_drink_message=We are running out of water supplies. Will you bring some more?[i2t]building_event_quest_medicine_message=Many of us need help.
Bring some medicines.[i2t]building_event_quest_camp_message=The camp always needs different useful things. Bring us the missing necessities.[i2t]building_event_quest_materials_message=The people are getting settled in here. Can you bring the missing materials?[i2t]building_event_quest_craft_message=There's a trouble with tools - they're getting broken all the time. Can you bring anything more durable?[i2t]building_event_quest_weapons_message=We have to arm everyone who can stand on their feet. Will you get us weapons?[i2t]building_event_quest_vehicles_message=A car requires constant maintenance.

第 3 赛季带着好消息开始了！存活者成功进入了 Bravo 地堡。除大厅外，地堡有 3 层。要启动电梯并到达较低层，你需要一台发电机。请记住，当你启动那里的终端时，你身后的门将关闭，并且没有时间多加思考，因为辐射水平会急剧增加，一群群僵尸会赶来，每一秒钟都非常重要。在每一层的尽头，你都必须击败头目。杀死头目，你会得到一个装有奖励的盒子。每一层的奖励都会越来越棒，在最后一层，等着你的是最稀有的奖品：全地形车的气瓶。在地堡中，有很多因素会对你造成不利影响，但你可以简化任务并修复大厅中的系统，这会消除每层中的任何两个可能导致你死亡的效果。Bravo 地堡里还有能够恢复因辐射减少的生命值的药品，以及装有能减轻辐射效果的抗辐射药的安瓿。抗辐射药必须提前使用。如果你在扫荡楼层时意识到自己无法完成，你可以返回，恢复你的数值，再重新启动终端。僵尸会重生，但至少你可以保住性命。

防御莫斯堡
一群来自废弃的莫斯堡的存活者在呼救！他们的营地正受到来自沼泽的成群僵尸袭击，堡垒无法承受猛烈攻击。拿起锤子和枪械，你将不得不在被摧毁的基地的基础上重建一个坚不可摧的堡垒，抵挡成群的沼泽僵尸。 
完成任务、帮助建造防御工事和与僵尸作战将获得奖励积分，让你登上赛季排名前列。高排名在获得奖品的数量上有所不同：每个顶级玩家都会得到全地形车零件作为奖励，但你获得的防御点数越多，排名越靠上，到赛季末你获得的全地形车零件就越多。排名每天都会更新，所以如果你决心得到最好的奖励，停留在过去的桂冠上是行不通的。如果地点升到最高级，则你可以抵御僵尸群的日常攻击，并在赛季结束前获得额外积分。排名奖励将在赛季末发放。

沼泽
沼泽里潜藏着什么？你必须调查清楚。可用的信息太少了。由于沼泽难以接近，它成了地图上最神秘的地方。众所周知，有 2 个不同难度的地点，到处都是罕见的僵尸。步行或骑摩托去那里必定会死在恶心的沼泽中。只有全地形车才能避免陷入困境，让你度过难关。此外，沼泽地充满了大量以前未知的资源：硫磺、泥炭、沼泽矿石等等。不知为何，那里甚至也生长着可食用的谷物、各种苗芽和香料。但可以肯定的是，只有最坚定的存活者才能揭开沼泽的秘密。



废品场
地图上出现了一个名为“废品场”的稀有活动。据说完成一些任务就可以获得合理的奖励，甚至全地形车的零件。但要做好准备，因为途中你可能遇到的不只是寻求帮助的和平存活者，还有一帮残忍的车手，他们几枪就会送不速之客上路。你只能在 40 级或以上时使用摩托车到达废品场。

钓鱼
这简直是大自然的奇迹 — 鱼儿又回到了我们的池塘！拿起钓竿，到有池塘的钓鱼地点，这些地点会以不同的频率出现在全球地图上。除了钓竿和一双灵巧的手，你还需要渔夫技能。凝望水面、静听虫鸣、沉思钓鱼都很棒。晚餐有鲑鱼吃就更棒了！存活者的饮食增加了各种鱼类菜肴，可提供各种增益。你可以在新的厨房炉灶上烹饪它们。

老虎机
有人把一辆不寻常的车开到了加油站。之所以不寻常，是因为车身上装了一台有奖老虎机。而且奖品不小！有 C4、小机枪、微声狙击步枪和其他超酷东西，但最重要的是，还有全地形车的传送装置和其他零件。你可以用在 Bravo 地堡获得的瓶盖和赛季战斗通行证来玩。大奖游戏中将会抽出宝贵的奖品：翻开瓶盖，3 个瓶盖图案相同的话，就会得到奖励。此外，大奖游戏还可以让你赢得额外的瓶盖，这些瓶盖可以在莱尼处交换摩托车用的全新精美皮肤。 

全地形车
山上的咆哮声是什么？是全地形车的引擎声，打破了方圆几里之内的寂静！组装这辆野兽般的车非常困难，在更新的配方中你需要很多零件。获得全地形车稀有零件的主要场所是 Bravo 地堡和加油站的老虎机。此外，它们还可以作为赛季排名活动“防御莫斯堡”的奖励而获得。 

自动清理地点
现在，你可以选择无需花费时间、能量和设备，从清理地点收集资源和经验值。地点窗口中有一项新功能，可让你自动清理口粮地点。有资源的地点可根据需要多次自动清理。警局和农场 — 仅限一次，Alfa 地堡 — 每个模式下一次。收集到的资源可在收件箱中找到。  

自动地点清理从 10 级起可于绿色和黄色的资源地点使用，从 15 级起可于红色地点使用，从 35 级起可于警局、农场和 Alfa 地堡使用。 

工作台和配方
没时间解释了，一大堆新的工作台和配方等着制作呢！一些配方包含来自沼泽核心的资源，这是组装全地形车去探索沼泽地的又一个理由。由于有了大量的新配方，它们的等级范围已更改。别担心，如果你的等级还升得不多，那只是时间问题而已。

升级架子
现在，你可以在你的基地存储更多物品！升级架子以增加其容量。从前你可以将 20 件原木存储在一个格子里，现在可以在其中放下多达 70 件。每升一级，格子的容量就会增加 5 件。

满是礼物和装饰品的节日时节已经到来，我们的僵尸末日第 4 赛季也来了！主要的庆祝活动将在尼克·桑蒂的房子里举行，你的老朋友将在那里等你。  
圣诞树装饰
尼克宣布在玩家之间举行比赛！他家有一棵圣诞树，非常适合过节。获得圣诞装饰品，用精致而稀有的装饰品装饰圣诞树，赢取积分并成为顶级玩家，即可在赛季结束时获得最酷的奖品！你得到的积分越多，排名就越高，赛季结束时你获得奖励的奖励就越多。直到最后都不要松懈 — 最后的比赛日至关重要。
装饰品精炼排名 
参加圣诞树装饰比赛需要各种不同的装饰品。为了成功地装饰圣诞树，你需要尼克·桑蒂家的两个工作台，用于装饰品回收和精炼。尼克·桑蒂的工作台可提高装饰品的排名价值，并为你增加积分。装饰品的精炼和升级是通过装饰品零件进行的。你可以从被杀死的僵尸那里得到这些零件以及圣诞树装饰，也可以在箱子和赛季活动地点找到它们，其中最珍贵和最稀有的隐藏在 Alfa 和 Bravo 地堡、农场、警局中。第二个工作台可让你回收不需要的装饰品，以获得可供精炼的零件。升级你的装饰品，让你的树发出最明亮的光辉！
照相机
老人尼克过于感伤了。他有一个还能用的旧照相机，把它放在了自己家里，这样存活者就可以在装饰精美的圣诞树前为自己拍照，然后在社交媒体上分享这些照片。他真是可爱！  
赛季地点
其他冬季活动会在 3 个赛季地点中发生：冰冻树林、雪地森林边缘、雪谷。不同的活动，以及包含头目在内的节日僵尸在等着你。其中一些去年圣诞就出现过，你可能很熟悉它们。这些地点会每个赛季周逐一开始，直到赛季结束前都处于激活状态。你每天可以访问两次这些地点。这些地点都非常冷，所以请穿上暖和的衣服，并带上一瓶烈性酒。或者多带几瓶。 
摩托车的新皮肤
圣诞时节为摩托车带来了一些新的皮肤，而不可思议的姜饼摩托车会让你沉浸在童年的温柔回忆中，当年奶奶会给你烤制美味的饼干和其他点心。现在，你可以骑着姜饼摩托车冲撞僵尸了，耶！

圣诞节假期结束了，然而节日的盛宴仍然在我们的后末日荒地进行着。好人尼克桑蒂可以带你去竞技场见见那里的居民：讨厌比利、狂野杰西和好运露西。
需要了解的基本知识。你可以每天多次召唤同一个头目。每一次胜利都会让你获得牙齿，可以在尼克那里换到很酷的奖励。每次胜利之后，头目都会变得更强，但你得到的牙齿也会更多。每个头目的进度每天都会重置一次。要进入竞技场，你需要血液试管，可以通过参加炮击、猎熊获得，也可在矿井得到。
炮击
想感受迫击炮的破坏力吗？来看看炮击活动。跟里克和克里夫见面，他们会告诉你如何在末日后的世界里享受乐趣！
 猎熊
熊比预期的早从冬眠中醒来，现在正在这些地点游荡。本地猎人已经为这只危险动物的皮开出了不错的价格。如果你准备争夺宝贵的奖金并测试你的探路技能，那么祝你好运！据说熊是地球上最危险的动物之一，这可不是空穴来风。
 矿井
传说在灾难期间，许多人试图在这个矿井里生存。但当那里变成僵尸的巢穴时，没人活着出来。矿井绝对是个危险的地方，但它也是宝贵的资源和竞技场通行证的重要来源。
 多样化的内衣和背包
 你终于可以改变存活者所拥有的唯一不变东西的外观，那就是内衣！为此，你必须学习一个新的蓝图，并制作一个衣柜。我们知道你一直在等这个功能！我们一直在看你们的意见 :) 顺便说一下，衣柜的功能已经发生了变化。现在你只有在更换内衣和背包时才需要它。要更改外观，请使用镜子。
 海报
 如果以上活动对你来说还不够，我们再为你提供一个。每个星期，您都可以在不同的地点找到 30 张海报。我们真的很努力地把它们隐藏在了最意想不到的地方。找到所有 30 张海报，即可获得宝贵的资源。如果你找到了海报，但却没在物品栏中看到它，请不要惊慌。本来就是这样设计的。还有，请确保与其他存活者分享你的发现，团队合作会使每项任务变得更加轻松！

守卫查克、猎人卡西、收藏家薇薇安和科学家哈利等几名存活者在河岸的营地避难。他们需要你帮助完成他们的任务，很快就会给你奖励。他们全靠你了！
任务和地点
除定居点外，第 6 赛季的行动区将分布在几个主要地点：小镇废墟和废弃村庄。同样，定居点居民的任务将带你进入入侵者营地、森林边缘的房子和熊的巢穴。
此外，他们私下里说，通过小镇废墟可以到达地下室或下水道。在那里，你一定会发现一些有趣的东西。不过那里很危险。
声望
定居点居民经历了很多事情，所以他们很难信任别人。你必须赢得他们的信任。每个居民都有一个声望等级，可以通过完成任务而获得的积分进行升级。最受尊敬的玩家可获得更多的奖励。
新的鱼
定居点设立在有鳟鱼的湖附近。你可以用鳟鱼制作 2 种新菜肴，能够带来实用的加成。对于尚未开启“渔夫”技能的人来说有个好消息：获得这一技能的机会提高了。准备好你的钓竿吧！
新摩托车、背包和内衣
成为一个炫酷存活者的最好方法是得到新的摩托车和背包。红色内衣也需要更换。除了赛季奖励列表中的摩托车外，你还有机会从莱尼那里得到一辆新的心爱摩托，他在加油站准备用它交换代币。

抢劫者在附近的监狱里建立了一个新的基地，那座监狱从前是用来关押最危险的罪犯的。有情报说，抢劫者在那里储存了很多有意思的贵重物品。值得查看一番。
车手营地
发动机的噪音将引导你来到车手们最近设立的营地。外人来到这里并非偶然，因为他们也听说了抢劫者的基地，并计划对监狱进行突袭。车手们愿意共同努力，参与大胆的抢夺。这听起来很诱人！了解营地任务的所有细节。
准备
抢夺的方法很重要。你可以选择：进行爆破突击或秘密潜行进入监狱。根据选择的选项，你必须完成一系列准备任务。并非所有任务都是强制性的，但你完成的越多，抢劫就越容易。
雇佣兵
为了使袭击更加成功，可以雇佣雇佣兵来帮助你应对抢劫者、增加战利品数量或带走更多的战利品。
全新装备和皮肤
是时候装备起来了！一套全新的抢劫者护甲和邪恶的摩托以及背包皮肤将会为你的末日后时代的优雅品味增色，而砍杀者的利刃将把你敌人的寿命减少到几秒钟。

Here, in the Distribution Centers, business things are humming. A lot of craftsmen and handymen offer their items and services in exchange for money.

There are two kinds of currency approved in the city - Coupons and Counterfoils.

 - Counterfoils stay at the seller after a deal is sealed. They can be used for paying services offered by specialists of the city.

关于他们的传闻很多，似乎都很准确：真正的僵尸猎人来到了我们的地盘。你可以在野外营地见到他们；他们正在寻求不容易被吓倒的存活者。你正是他们需要的人！
合同
野外营地的专家们捕捉并研究僵尸。向他们提供协助，以获得不错的奖励和声望。
所有的猎人都已经到了，所以从本赛季的第一周开始就可以签订狩猎僵尸的合同。不过科学家们还在路上。研究合同从第二周开始方可签订。
签订合同来追踪和研究怪物，也许你将能揭示毁灭人类的原因之谜。
捕捉和研究
并非任何僵尸都适合研究，只有特殊的僵尸才行。可以通过发光的眼睛来识别合适的僵尸，不过，并不是所有的僵尸都愿意被发现，所以要了解它们的习性，把它们引出来。僵尸对响声、强光和强烈的气味都有反应，此外，特殊的引诱设备也会派上用场。
将僵尸运送到野外营地需要特殊的网，能够困住任何怪物，所以最好尽快获得。我们这次不要出现悲剧。
成为兼职科学家十分容易：接受一份研究合同，将所需的僵尸与必要的研究设备送到营地，然后开始工作。通过试错，你一定会成功！
天气
僵尸末日很精彩， 但全球变暖呢？完成合同后，小雨、雷暴和闪电将会改变普通的天气情况，变成飓风、浓雾和其他令人不快的沉降物，如放射性尘埃。 
当然，也不能没有地狱般的高温和清爽的北极霜冻，是不是？
显然，天气状况可能会让捕捉僵尸的过程变得简单，也可能会增加难度，所以要保持警惕。 你永远不知道谁会想在血月下与你同行。
实验室
要研究僵尸，你需要各种标本和用品，这些东西可以在资源地点、被毁的实验室、科学家的货车里找到。囤积武器！在那里，你将不可避免地面临危险和各种事件。
赛季通行证
赛季通行证系统及其设计都得到了改善，现在包含 60 级及更多内容。在达到高级通行证的 60 级后，你将可以无限提升自己的等级，并尽自己最大的能力获得更多的奖励。
更新的赛季通行证和赛季活动结合得更紧密；不仅完成任务能得到经验值，在野外营地完成合同也能获得。所以，你捕捉和研究的僵尸越多，获得的经验值和奖励就越多。[i2t]sync_tournament_tier_0=Scouts Tournament[i2t]sync_tournament_tier_1=Seekers Tournament[i2t]sync_tournament_tier_2=Stalkers Tournament[i2t]sync_tournament_level_tip_1=Take a prize-winning place to participate in Seekers Tournament[i2t]sync_tournament_level_tip_2=Take a prize-winning place to participate in Stalkers Tournament[i2t]sync_tournament_level_tip_3=Take a prize-winning place to stay in Stalkers Tournament[i2t]sync_chopper_use_window_desciption=Personal transport is not just prestigious but also the only excisting way to reach the most valuable resources far away from the Crater.[i2t]sync_ui_recoloring_dialog_label=Required:[i2t]sync_tournament_reward_box_0_name=Scouts' equipment[i2t]sync_tournament_reward_box_1_name=Seekers' equipment[i2t]sync_tournament_reward_box_2_name=Stalkers' equipment[i2t]sync_tournament_reward_boxes_description=For opening you will get 1 item.

在弹坑中，比赛的形式略有改变。规则还是一样，但现在会有三种类型的比赛。所有的比赛都是从初级开始的，如果你最终跻身前三名之一，就会进入更高级的类型，获得更珍贵的奖励。如果你跌出前三名，就会回到初级的比赛中去。为了获得更好的物品，要努力哦！商店任何社会的鲜明特色都是对与众不同的渴望。所以市民可以用不同的皮肤来装饰自己的商店，并因此获得额外的人气点数。当然，这是为了生意。贫民窟的工作弹坑政府改变了接受新市民的方式。现在，人们必须从贫民窟开始，登上社会阶梯，达到分配中心或军团所在地。[i2t]shop_dota_gacha_deathgiving_name=Deathgiving Pack[i2t]shop_deathgiving_banner_name=Deathgiving Pack[i2t]shop_deathgiving_banner_description=Limited offer of Thanskgiving Day![i2t]shop_dota_gacha_footman_name=Footman's Pack[i2t]shop_footman_banner_name=Footman's Pack[i2t]shop_footman_banner_description=Reliable equipment at an affordable price[i2t]shop_dota_gacha_operative_name=Operative's Pack[i2t]shop_operative_banner_name=Operative's Pack[i2t]shop_operative_banner_description=Try out the equipment of the secret squad[i2t]shop_pack_genesis_stripe_name=Stripes[i2t]shop_pack_genesis_stripe_description=Stripes can be exchanged for a pack for goods to be delivered or delivery insurance[i2t]shop_pack_thanksgiving_feast_name=Festive treat[i2t]shop_pack_thanksgiving_feast_description=Set the table, invite guests.

The caravan guys would turn a blind eye to many habits of his because he was always extremely efficient. And now, he’s suddenly missing. [i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_1_header=Missing Key[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_1_description=Despite a spotty reputation, K was always known to be punctual, but he’s been missing for a few days now. Last I heard, he went to the military outpost. Gotta go to the Genesis base and find out what Jake knows about it.[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_2_header=Nothing but trouble[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_2_description=For a man that doesn't want to be found he's not very good at hiding. What's weird is that he's not only causing problems but also solving them. No clue where to go next. I've heard something about a convoy though... I'll talk to Jake.[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_3_header=In sheep’s clothing[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_3_description=What did he ask the doctor about, I wonder. It might be the key to the whole thing. No matter, I'll find out soon enough. The coordinates point to a place called Wolven Glade, I need to know more about it before I start packing.[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_4_header=Buried past[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_4_description=The further I go, the stranger things get. Obviously, those two weren't the original recipients, but how did they know about K? Why everyone knows about him?  I'm clearly missing something. According to them, my next stop should be a hidden cellar though.[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_5_header=My shadow and me[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_5_description=Whoever that was, I won't find him at the camp. My gut tells me that the present left for his brother may be suddenly looted. The odds are not in his favor. However, he may turn out to be useful...[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_6_header=Sunk costs[i2t]season_12_tab_1_event_6_description=The finish line. I really hope it all wasn't in vain. Besides, I’m not exactly fond of laboratories, especially of the ruined kind. [i2t]season_12_tab_3_header=Eva[i2t]season_12_tab_3_description=There's been a series of inexplicably cruel attacks on the local community. Eva took advantage of the caravan making a stop and went to investigate intriguing marks left by the monster that didn't match any known kind of the infected. [i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_1_header=Fox[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_1_description=It's time to meet Fox and ask him about the client. Rumor has it that he had sent caught "trophies" to some scientist, the former member of Genesis. Now, Fox with his companion are on Hunting Path. They're waiting for their package with weapons. I'll talk to Jake to get the goods.[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_2_header=First meeting[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_2_description=I've managed to find out that the client will be waiting for a package from Fox at Town Ruins. Fox is dead, so I'll have to deliver the package myself and make contact with that scientist. It might be her.[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_3_header=Brawl in Sand Grove[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_3_description=Our first meeting was not so well. However, we lucked out. A few minutes ago I got informed that her bike had been noticed in Sand Grove. Hopefully, this time nothing will get in our way.[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_4_header=Raiders' Camp[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_4_description=Raiders have caught Eva, and I couldn't stop them.

The most important thing is to remember that we have no right to make a mistake.[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_5_header=Surgery[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_5_description=During the escape, Eva was injured and lost too much blood.

Robert told me we're running out of time and we need to hurry.[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_6_header=Relocation[i2t]season_12_tab_3_event_6_description=Eva left. She headed her old base to pick up her stuff and join us. Guess I should monitor the relocation and, deliver a parcel for her, as well.[i2t]season_12_tab_2_header=Chris[i2t]season_12_tab_2_description=Chris hasn't been seen by anyone for a long time. He's one of the most talented engineers in Genesis. It's rumoured that he'd lived alone for a while, then got in with bikers, maybe to start a new life or because of despair.[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_1_header=Bikers' Camp[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_1_description=They say that Chris has got in with a group of bikers. One group has set up a camp nearby, maybe they know something. Jake must have a delivery for them, I'll go see him first.[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_2_header=Echoes of the past[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_2_description=I've found out the location of Chris's old house. Chris himself is unlikely there, but at least there might be some important clues for continuing the search.[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_3_header=Forgotten van[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_3_description=Looks like the bikers got interested in the old van of Genesis. There might be left some important equipment the use of which is unlikely known to them. There's a chance they may take Chris with them.[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_4_header=Old Camp[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_4_description=When I last saw Chris, we didn't have a chance to speak, he was taken away immediately. Those bikers are really wierd. I was provided with the location of their previous camp, it's worth checking up. I'll talk to Jake to take a new package.[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_5_header=Meeting at Radio Tower[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_5_description=Chris doesn't seem to be happy about messing with bikers. I've found out that he was sent to Radio Tower unaccompanied. This is a chance to talk to him privately.[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_6_header=Home detention[i2t]season_12_tab_2_event_6_description=We haven't managed to speak again. I heard Chris has returned to Bikers' Camp. Now they don't let him go anywhere, perhaps, because of the incident with Radio Tower. I can't wait any longer, it's time to get Chris back.[i2t]shop_dota_gacha_infinite_name=Final Frontier Pack[i2t]shop_pack_halloween_2020_name=Pack against evil spirits[i2t]shop_pack_halloween_2020_description=Nothing will cloud your day[i2t]shop_halloween_2020_banner_name=Halloween sale[i2t]shop_dota_gacha_halloween_container_name=Halloween container[i2t]shop_dota_gacha_halloween_container_description=Get coupons for participating in Halloween Sale[i2t]shop_halloween_containter_banner_description=Exchange coupons for special rewards![i2t]shop_halloween_coupon_name=Halloween coupon[i2t]shop_notify_not_enough_resources_header=Not enough resources[i2t]shop_notify_not_enough_resources_description=Resources can be obtained through participation in the sale[i2t]character_skin_view_backpack_titan_name=Titan[i2t]inventory_stack_view_backpack_titan_name=Backpack style "Titan"[i2t]character_skin_view_backpack_voodoo_name=Voodoo[i2t]inventory_stack_view_backpack_voodoo_name=Backpack style "Voodoo"[i2t]character_skin_view_backpack_cargo_name=Cargo[i2t]inventory_stack_view_backpack_cargo_name=Backpack style "Cargo"[i2t]character_skin_view_backpack_vampire_name=Vampire[i2t]inventory_stack_view_backpack_vampire_name=Backpack style "Vampire"[i2t]inventory_stack_view_bikeskin_loco_name=Model "The Loco"[i2t]inventory_stack_view_bikeskin_loco_short_name=The Loco[i2t]inventory_stack_view_bikeskin_commander_name=Model "Commander"[i2t]inventory_stack_view_bikeskin_commander_short_name=Commander[i2t]inventory_stack_view_bikeskin_arachne_name=Model "Arachne"[i2t]inventory_stack_view_bikeskin_arachne_short_name=Arachne[i2t]inventory_stack_view_bikeskin_pumpkin_name=Model "Bike-o'-Lantern"[i2t]inventory_stack_view_bikeskin_pumpkin_short_name=Bike-o'-Lantern[i2t]inventory_stack_view_halloween_gravestone_name=Gravestone[i2t]inventory_stack_view_halloween_gravestone_description=Wicked decoration for your base[i2t]inventory_stack_view_hoop_name=Basketball hoop[i2t]inventory_stack_view_hoop_description=All you need is to create your own team[i2t]season_12_character_1_event_1_phrase_1=If you want to get in, lend us a hand first and clear out the infected[i2t]season_12_character_1_event_1_phrase_2=Whatever you are after, you'd better be quick, things are about to get messy[i2t]season_12_character_1_event_1_phrase_3=Thieving bastards![i2t]season_12_character_1_event_1_phrase_4=We had a deal![i2t]season_12_character_1_event_1_phrase_5=We’ll teach you a lesson[i2t]season_12_character_1_event_1_phrase_6=We didn’t take anything, but now, we sure as hell are going to[i2t]season_12_character_1_event_1_phrase_7=Do you bleed?

注意！这不是演习。发现了新的永久性地点“港口”！
这个地方将会开启存活者冒险之旅的新篇章，并且改变僵尸末日世界的日常。港口埋藏着大量的秘密，还有隐藏地点等你来发现。现在就来探索这片区域吧！  
下水道 
探索过港口后，你就会发现一条通往地下的通道，进入阴暗潮湿的下水道。这个由地下隧道组成的网络中充满了珍贵和稀有物品。但有一个问题。最后一个待在那里的人淹没了那些地下通道。所以你得先把里面的水抽干。 
摩托艇
在僵尸事件彻底恶化之前，航海家们常常把他们的船舶停靠在港口。虽然他们很早以前就废弃了这个地方，但还留下了丰富的礼物。在这里，你可以找到个人摩托艇的蓝图。 
主要部分就保留在港口，但要获得蓝图就得在下水道中工作。这是值得的——你可能会是第一个离开家园，开启未知领域之旅的人。
岛屿地点
有了新的摩托艇，你就可以深入港湾地区，探索神秘的岛屿。基本没有关于这些岛屿的信息，但有一点可以确定，上面有着丰富的极其稀有的资源。风险是有的，但在那儿能够找到的东西完全值得去冒险。
新的资源
更多好消息！发现了钛及其他一些新资源。这会给制作物品列表带来重大变化——现在你甚至可以组装枪械。新资源主要来源于港口和岛屿地点。 

货物运送回来了！发货地点现在永久性地设在港口。另外，引入了新的起源声望系统。运送包裹或获得声望积分，每次等级提升时均可获得特殊奖励。例如，新的能够穿透敌人护甲的试验性武器！ 
圣诞赛季
尽管舒适的僵尸末日世界发生了翻天覆地的动乱，但圣诞节还是会如期来临。尼克·桑蒂也一起来了！
而且他将需要你的帮助。他想让当地人感到幸福，于是安排了人递送祝贺信件，但送货的人不负责任，导致信件丢失。帮助这个可怜人找到那些信件，拯救美好节日。在搜索的过程中，你会到达活动地点冰风谷和将于第 2 周开放的路边房子。如果你幸运地找到了所有信件的话，就可以在第 3 周到达冰冻村庄。尼克相信你！
工厂
今年的圣诞派对将在奇怪工厂举行。那里有着完美节日所需的一切：圣诞树、礼物，甚至还有圣诞老人！我是说，僵尸圣诞老人。在工厂里可以找到一个分发不同圣诞资源的传送带，这些资源需要使用赛季货币购买。获取赛季货币的方式就是你最喜欢的杀怪。 
不过考验是不可避免的。锁在工厂里的 3 个头目想要当面祝贺你。带上从传送带上拿到的特殊钥匙去探访它们，享受一场僵尸末日风格的派对吧！ [i2t]inventory_stack_view_delivery_christmas_empty_box_name=Empty christmas box[i2t]inventory_stack_view_delivery_christmas_empty_box_description=Festive decorations and treats[i2t]inventory_stack_view_delivery_christmas_box_name=Christmas box[i2t]inventory_stack_view_delivery_christmas_box_description=Festive decorations and treats[i2t]inventory_stack_view_genesis_reputation_item_1_description=Use to increase your reputation with Genesis corporation[i2t]sync_carpet_bear=Bearskin[i2t]sync_carpet_1=Dark carpet[i2t]sync_carpet_2=Hallway mat[i2t]sync_carpet_3=Rubik carpet [i2t]sync_carpet_4=Chess carpet [i2t]sync_carpet_5=Round carpet[i2t]sync_carpet_6=Stripe carpet [i2t]sync_carpet_7=Fluffy carpet [i2t]sync_carpet_8=Starry sky сarpet [i2t]sync_carpet_9=Chile сarpet [i2t]sync_carpet_10=Puzzle сarpet[i2t]sync_carpet_11=Alpaca сarpet [i2t]sync_carpet_12=Pocahontas сarpet [i2t]sync_carpet_13=Desert сarpet [i2t]sync_carpet_14=Persia сarpet [i2t]sync_coffee_table=Coffee table[i2t]sync_loft_table=Table "Loft"[i2t]sync_triangle_table=Triangular table[i2t]sync_stump_table=Stump table[i2t]sync_concrete_table=Concrete table[i2t]sync_carton_table=Cardboard box[i2t]ui_seasons_daily_challenges_req=Daily tasks will be available in[i2t]sync_luxury_toilet=Luxury toilet [i2t]sync_cups_and_trophies=Trophies[i2t]sync_tournament_gold_cup=Stalkers Tournament Cup[i2t]sync_tournament_silver_cup=Seekers Tournament Cup[i2t]sync_tournament_bronze_cup=Scouts Tournament Cup[i2t]sync_trophy_miner_boss=Head of Miner[i2t]sync_trophy_devourer_boss=Head of Devourer[i2t]idfa_ui_dialog_additional_description=Allow the application to use information from our partners and it will be easier for us to optimize the offers and the game process for you.[i2t]sync_builder_need_space=No free space in apartment[i2t]delivery_insurance_buy_confirmation=Are you sure you want to purchase insurance?

After a while, its lock will open automatically. Be careful, though, you're not the only one who craves to take a look inside![i2t]sync_tips_pvp_flare=Those who are hiding in the tall grass can be spotted if you throw a flare in the bushes.[i2t]shop_dota_gacha_8_march_2021_pack_name=Spring Season Pack[i2t]shop_dota_gacha_8_march_2021_pack_description=Meet the spring fully armed![i2t]sync_backpackskin_green_leaf_name=Spring[i2t]sync_bikeskin_the_buzzard_description=Can be obtained from Nat the Fighter for dog tags[i2t]sync_backpackskin_desert_khaki_description=Can be obtained from Nat the Fighter for dog tags[i2t]sync_pvp_crate_opened_by=Crate opened by player:[i2t]sync_pvp_crate_is_available=Crate available[i2t]season_14_event_panel_header=Cure for Life[i2t]season_14_event_panel_description=You're never prepared for what you'll see in Pandora's box. The price of arrogance is too high. But not today. This time everything will be different...[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_1_header=Everything is fine[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_1_started=K broke the radio silence for the first time in a long while. He's waiting for me at the Genesis outpost. He says it's urgent.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_1_finished=What's with the theatrics I wonder. K could've talked to the scientists himself. At least we'll finally find out what happened in the lab.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_2_header=Lock and key[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_2_started=The preparation for the lab's opening is almost complete. We just have to go back to the lab entrance at the port. K is already waiting.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_2_finished=Everytime I close my eyes I see a corridor basking in the red light. I can still hear the guy's screams drowning in a siren's blare. We were ready for anything, but not this.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_3_header=Weight of change[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_3_started=Rumors about massive spore colonies and new weird creatures are spreading across the camp. I need to keep an eye on the outpost to prevent that menace from spreading any further.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_3_finished=It's too early to talk about a finished antidote, but the first tests are going well. Eva is asking for more samples. She seems optimistic about the whole thing. That scares me.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_4_header=Deja vu[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_4_started=We received information that a new infestation outbreak has been detected in a village not too far from here. Seems like a good opportunity for Chris to test out his new dissolver...[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_4_finished=We can't keep up with how the infestation is progressing. Chris's device needs work. The antidote creation process slowed down. And no one knows what to do with that damn barrier.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_5_header=Nowhere to run[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_5_started=Chris decided not to wait for anyone, and left to test out the improved dissolver on the barrier in the village. No one has seen him since. Eva asked us to find out what happened to him.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_5_finished=K calls them awakeners — conductors of the hive mind's will, which is behind all of this. We need to find it before it's too late.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_6_header=Perfect circle[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_6_started=The antidote is ready for dispersal, but we just can't find the center of the infestation. We need to go back to the lab where it all began to figure out what to do next.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_breakpoint_6_finished=Spreading antidote will take a while, but the worst is behind us. I know there's danger lurking in the depths of the lab, but I sure hope we'll find some answers down there too.[i2t]season_14_event_panel_progress_tip=Collect samples and receive rewards![i2t]season_14_event_1_note_1=No major changes in the sample's behavior were noted. No active response to the chemical treatment was detected. Growth rates are within the established norm.[i2t]season_14_event_1_note_2=Signal. It puts out a signal. Low-frequency, very weak, but stable. Jerry is not listening to me. We shouldn't go there without fully understanding what we're dealing with.[i2t]season_14_event_2_note_1=I know, Ginny. I know. All in good time. I know that if I abandon my research, there will be even more letters like this in the world. I know that I miss you more and more with each passing day. I know I shouldn't, but sometimes I just...[i2t]season_14_event_2_note_2=There's nothing left for me here. And the locals are always trying to steal something. I've arranged to have my stuff transported to New Eden. They say, there are plenty of interesting trinkets to be found there.[i2t]season_14_event_3_note_1=I finally realized that I'm ready to go back. But instead of home, I found nothing but ruins covered in spores. There's no point in staying here for much longer, but I need to get closer and learn what I can about the new threat.[i2t]season_14_event_final_note_1=Someone wrote in blood on a crumpled piece of paper: 

The case holds no answers. Don't believe his lies.[i2t]season_14_port_note_1=They say it's the fever talking. But yesterday I was completely alone, and now I hear a voice in the endless choir. It beckons me, getting louder and stronger, louder and stronger, louder and...[i2t]season_14_port_note_2=Eva. You never listen, and now it's too late. It's coming. I sure hope you are praying right now. And if you aren't. You really should be.[i2t]season_14_intro_event_1_phrase_1=Let's find out how the preparation for the opening is coming along[i2t]season_14_intro_event_1_phrase_2=Who are you? Where's Carl?[i2t]season_14_intro_event_1_phrase_3=He's not feeling well, I'm covering for him for the time being[i2t]season_14_intro_event_1_phrase_4=I see. Did we get anything specific from the samples?[i2t]season_14_intro_event_1_phrase_5=We found no problems except for one little hitch[i2t]season_14_intro_event_1_phrase_6=But it's nothing serious, Carl will explain it to you later[i2t]season_14_intro_event_1_phrase_7=Permission granted, I have the access code. See you at the port[i2t]season_14_intro_event_2_phrase_1=How are the guys doing, K? Do they miss the port's fresh air yet?[i2t]season_14_intro_event_2_phrase_2=No, just you and your jokes. Well, is everyone ready? Then let's get started[i2t]season_14_intro_event_2_phrase_3=Everything is not where it should be. I don't like it[i2t]season_14_intro_event_2_phrase_4=Dispatch. We have a serious problem...[i2t]season_14_intro_intermission_phrase_1=Slow down, take it easy. The worst's already happened[i2t]season_14_intro_intermission_phrase_2=We don't understand the nature of the spores yet, but they definitely don't make people feel better[i2t]season_14_intro_intermission_phrase_3=The spores had no effect on K, but I didn't get a chance to figure out why. He went to the outpost right away[i2t]season_14_intro_intermission_phrase_4=The rest of the team wasn't as lucky: after being exposed to a high dose of spores, they escaped custody and disappeared[i2t]season_14_intro_intermission_phrase_5=The development of an antidote will take a lot of time and lots of samples. Which is what you're going to help us with[i2t]season_14_intro_intermission_phrase_6=But first, find K. We haven't heard from him since. Maybe he's still at the outpost[i2t]season_14_event_1_phrase_1=How could I know...[i2t]season_14_event_1_phrase_2=I don't have time to explain why I don't have time to explain[i2t]season_14_intermission_1_phrase_1=We need to keep the infection under control. Watch the outpost. Maybe K will get back there[i2t]season_14_intermission_1_phrase_2=If we want to get rid of that thing, we'll need lots of samples collected from the new type of the infected[i2t]season_14_intermission_1_phrase_3=Chris, how is the dissolver prototype coming along?[i2t]season_14_intermission_1_phrase_4=We still have a long way to go till the field testing, but we're working on it. Getting more materials wouldn't hurt...[i2t]season_14_event_2_phrase_1=Finally, some fun. Watch my back while I'm checking the prototype[i2t]season_14_event_2_phrase_2=What the... I'll grab a sample for Eva, and you stay away from that thing for the time being[i2t]season_14_event_2_phrase_3=What a dump. What's with the face? You look like you just saw a ghost[i2t]season_14_event_2_phrase_4=Welp, this is not what I had in mind. There's much work to be done on the prototype. See you at the camp[i2t]season_14_event_2_phrase_5=You don't look like the infected. Have you isolated the sewer entrance?[i2t]season_14_event_2_phrase_6=Ah. Right, we did it ourselves, but it was too late. That's where the spores came from[i2t]season_14_event_2_phrase_7=Samantha, Ginny, and now everyone else. No. I need to keep working[i2t]season_14_event_2_phrase_8=I'm going to the port, and you... Please, try to stay alive[i2t]season_14_intermission_2_phrase_1=So the rumors turned out to be true. We need samples from the new type of spore zombies! [i2t]season_14_intermission_2_phrase_2=Our walk in the village gave me an idea, but tweaking the prototype will take some time[i2t]season_14_intermission_2_phrase_3=Don't let the infection spread beyond the village and keep an eye on the barrier, we'll get back to it later[i2t]season_14_event_3_phrase_1=You're just in time, as always. The infected that reside here seem different. It feels like something is controlling them[i2t]season_14_event_3_phrase_2=Carl mentioned a signal in his notes. One of its sources is somewhere nearby. Let's go[i2t]season_14_event_3_phrase_3=Look for the materials we need to repair the bridge. I'll be on the lookout[i2t]season_14_event_3_phrase_4=We need to find and destroy the source of the signal, or we're screwed[i2t]season_14_event_3_phrase_5=Is it just me or did something move in there? Could it be... Chris?! [i2t]season_14_event_3_phrase_6=Keep exploring the cave, I'll try to get him out of it[i2t]season_14_event_3_phrase_7=They evolve at incredible pace. It's unfortunate that there's no way for us to coexist. I'll take the sample to the camp[i2t]season_14_event_3_phrase_8=Thank you, friends! Don't worry about me. Let's just check how the dissolver works[i2t]season_14_event_3_phrase_9=I love the smell of fried shrooms in the morning![i2t]season_14_intermission_3_phrase_1=I think I got it. They operate like a hive. Spore runners and shamblers are the defenders of the colony[i2t]season_14_intermission_3_phrase_2=They need sources of energy to transmit the signal and to keep evolving at incredible speed[i2t]season_14_intermission_3_phrase_3=And the tunnels allow them to travel long distances quickly and easily without being noticed[i2t]season_14_intermission_3_phrase_4=We need more samples to figure out what controls them and, more importantly, where from[i2t]season_14_event_final_phrase_1=There's something wrong in the lab. Hurry, look for yourselves![i2t]season_14_event_final_phrase_2=Somehow, I don't feel like going in there. Still shaken a bit from the whole cave incident[i2t]season_14_event_final_phrase_3=I feel like thousands of eyes are watching us[i2t]season_14_event_final_phrase_4=That's not how I imagined it... Doesn't matter, we have a lot of work to do. We need to clean this all up first[i2t]season_14_outpost_event_name=Genesis outpost[i2t]season_14_outpost_event_description=An unremarkable research post. Doubles as a symptom of Genesis's ever-increasing influence[i2t]season_14_village_event_name=Infected village[i2t]season_14_village_event_description=The spores spread at a terrifying rate. It's a good thing that this village seems to be abandoned[i2t]season_14_event_1_scientist_name=Jerry[i2t]avatars_view_sporeling_zombie_name=Spore zombie[i2t]avatars_view_scaly_sporeling_zombie_name=Shambler[i2t]avatars_view_spore_spreader_zombie_name=Spore spreader[i2t]avatars_view_mini_hive_mind_name=Awakener[i2t]avatars_view_hive_mind_name=Alpha awakener[i2t]season_14_event_1_note_2_name=Carl's journal[i2t]season_14_event_2_note_2_name=Vivien's note[i2t]season_14_event_3_note_1_name=Casey's diary[i2t]season_14_port_note_1_name=Patient's records[i2t]season_14_radio_event_1_description=There's a trail of scales leading to the forest.

第 14 赛季的一个主要目标就是针对感染研制解毒剂。若要成功，则需要从受感染地点的僵尸孢子中收集特殊样本。主要的条件就是共同完成任务。每个玩家对于共同进度的投入越大，则存活者就越接近解毒剂的成功研制。只有合作才能成功！[i2t]chopper_paint_free_button_name=Paint[i2t]chopper_paint_free_description=Thanks for your purchase!<br>Get your Chopper painted for free as a gift![i2t]inventory_stack_view_scumfish_name=Scumfish[i2t]inventory_stack_view_scumfish_description=You haven't seen anything worse in your entire life[i2t]guaranteed_gacha_weapon_name=Gunsmith's crate[i2t]guaranteed_gacha_weapon_description=A weapon and an equipment item in every crate.

The next step is to find the drop spot mentioned in the notes of the victim.[i2t]season_15_investigation_board_panel_case_1_quest_1_task=Evidence found[i2t]season_15_investigation_board_panel_case_1_quest_2_description_open=Following an anonymous tip, we've discovered a raiders' base, where the locals sell off stolen goods.

Lately, I've been seeing this name more and more frequently. And now people have started to disappear.

Apparently, we started to worry a little too early.[i2t]season_15_investigation_board_panel_case_2_quest_2_description_closed=Ciphers? Raiders? Chests? So far it doesn't make sense what all this has to do with a small, remote village. But one thing is certain - Sammy doesn't come from a simple family.[i2t]season_15_investigation_board_panel_case_2_quest_2_task=House searched[i2t]season_15_investigation_board_panel_case_2_quest_3_description_open=Another message from Sammy assuring us that he is close to figuring out the situation. We have to get back to the village and close this case for good.[i2t]season_15_investigation_board_panel_case_2_quest_3_description_closed=The missing villagers have been found, technically. The case can be considered closed. However, I can't help but feel that we stumbled on something much bigger than it seems and it's only a beginning...[i2t]season_15_investigation_board_panel_case_2_quest_3_task=Return to village[i2t]season_15_investigation_board_panel_case_3_quest_1_description_open=Some people are born troublemakers.

欢迎来到低温实验室和武器工厂——新增的两个可供探索的实验室分区。你会遇到危险的陷阱和新型头目，因此这趟旅行不会那么轻松。如果不想这次出行成为你的最后一次，那就时刻保持警惕。
全新特性和困难模式
我们还给硬核玩家准备了一个惊喜。现在大家可以体验终端中的新特性，这些特性会让分区探索之旅更加精彩刺激。如果这还不够的话，不妨去试试困难模式，从而帮助你在探索的同时增加声望。
声望
在困难模式中找到的特殊新物品可以为你提高实验室声望等级。每次提高声望等级都会获得特殊奖励：独特的套装风格、全新特性以及由起源的人慷慨提供的港口新仓库扩展。因此，困难模式不仅可以满足你的硬核游戏需求，而且好处多多。
装甲僵尸
如果增加难度，就会遇到特殊的装甲僵尸。常规武器基本上不可能会伤到它们，因此你得使用游戏中将会出现的穿甲武器。护甲越坚硬，就需要越强大的武器才能穿透。这个可以通过界面上的特殊图标进行识别。
障碍和码头
从现在开始，你可以使用斧头来清理掉第一层的一些障碍。另外，玩家还可以进入设有枪匠台的有顶码头，并且可以养殖海草作为生物反应器的燃料。[i2t]lab_boss_b1_name=Icebreaker[i2t]lab_boss_b2_name=Blight MK VIII[i2t]lab_boss_CEO_name=Corrupted CEO[i2t]lab_treasure_lurker_name=Pest[i2t]lab_janitor_name=Janitor[i2t]genesis_shotgun_name=Protector[i2t]genesis_shotgun_description=Workhorse of the Genesis security service.

在第 16 赛季中，你将成为一个私人社区的一员，可能之前你就看到过他们的标记。这次引入的结果如何取决于你本人，而且可能会使涉及到的所有人受益。是时候再破解一个荒地的谜团了。
迷宫
迷宫是社区用来迎接和测试新人的地方。在迷宫看护人坚持不懈的努力下，每次进入里面都会有新的体验。
试炼、声望和奖励
社区居民正忙着公社大型活动的准备工作。通过参与试炼来帮助他们。警告：可能不只是围在火边跳舞这样的无害活动。看看他们诡异的祭坛就知道了。成功通过试炼并完成社区领导的任务后，声望等级和获得有用物品的几率均会提高。另外，声望等级还会影响你的赛季奖励。
强化砖石建筑
没有人喜欢不速之客，尤其是那些把家里洗劫一空的强盗。不忍了！新的资源——砖块——可以用来建造僵尸末日史上最牢固的墙壁，让你的基地看起来更有范儿，并挡住那些闹事分子。
建筑材料仓库和冰箱
从现在起，建筑材料可以移到一个特殊的仓库。你不用再带着材料到处跑或者特意回去架子上寻找施工需要的材料。建造墙壁和地板的时候，可以随时使用这个仓库的资源。听起来很方便吧？另外还有一个特别宽敞的冰箱可以用来存放食物。
树木和树篱
自从僵尸末日来临后，存活者砍倒的树木不计其数。是时候在周围领地上进行一些景观美化工作了。在你家附近种植树篱和树苗，这样就可以随时在树荫下休憩避暑。最终，这些树苗都会长大，形成一片美丽的森林。而且，想要原木的话，就近取材即可。[i2t]quest_list_season_16_visit_commune=Visit Commune[i2t]quest_list_season_16_listen_to_people=Listen to the villagers[i2t]quest_list_season_16_complete_trial_1=Partake in the Trial of Will[i2t]quest_list_season_16_listen_to_marcus=Listen to Marcus[i2t]quest_list_season_16_track_down=Follow the trail[i2t]quest_list_season_16_check_camp=Check around the camp[i2t]quest_list_season_16_wait_for_marcus=Wait for Marcus[i2t]quest_list_season_16_neutralize_jacob=Neutralize Jacob[i2t]quest_list_season_16_fend_off_zombies=Fend off zombies[i2t]quest_list_season_16_talk_to_carrie=Talk to Carrie by the bonfire[i2t]quest_list_season_16_find_otis=Find Otis[i2t]quest_list_season_16_follow_otis=Follow Otis[i2t]quest_list_season_16_complete_trial_2=Partake in the Trial of Fortitude[i2t]quest_list_season_16_find_sophia=Find Sophia's assistant[i2t]quest_list_season_16_follow_sophia=Follow Sophia's assistant[i2t]quest_list_season_16_complete_trial_3=Partake in the Trial of Blood[i2t]quest_list_season_16_listen_to_otis=Listen to Otis[i2t]quest_list_season_16_listen_to_sophia=Listen to Sophia[i2t]quest_list_season_16_find_letters=Find Otis' letters[i2t]quest_list_season_16_find_out_what_happened=Find out what happened[i2t]personal_quest_2_2_panel_name=Villager[i2t]personal_quest_2_2_panel_description=Fetch me a rope and a bottle of whiskey[i2t]personal_quest_1_1_more_reputation_phrase_1=No one knows who built the Maze and when.

你将在荒地中发现一个新的未被探索的地方，也就是挖掘点“回声-1”。在这个地点的营地中，你将遇到给你开出特别交易的陌生人。你的任务就是不间断地生产一种特殊合金。但问题就在于，生产这种珍贵资源的提取器会发出很大的噪音，将附近草丛深处潜伏着的好奇僵尸引过来。
防御提取器
在启动精炼厂带动整个系统前，你必须占据一个防御性位置。布置炮塔和陷阱，囤积武器和护甲，并且构思好战术。在特殊模式下启动精炼厂会增加任务的挑战性，但同时也会提高潜在的收益。难度级别设置还会决定影响游戏过程多样性的修改器。

同伴
在僵尸末日世界中，不论何时最好都结伴行动。但首先，你得找到同伴。在潜在的同伴人选中，有你在荒地上从未见过的人，当然也有老熟人。他们每一个人都有自己独特的技能，这些将在防御中派上用场。他们不会一直跟着你，因此请选择最符合你要求的同伴。 
废弃工厂
这间工厂似乎废弃了很多年，就像踏入史蒂芬·金的小说中一般。这座地下工业建筑里藏着很多可怕的秘密和珍贵的资源。盗贼都会绕过这个地方，因此里面有大量材料，在挖掘点“回声-1”的防御准备过程中可以派上用场。
走私货
除了普通的赛季奖励外，你还可以获得其他奖励。如果你手上有赛季最火的资源，即奇怪矿物和特殊合金，只要联系走私者，剩下的就不用操心了。 [i2t]avatars_view_dead_day_killer_man_name=Tough guy[i2t]avatars_view_dead_day_killer_man_phrase_1=I'm so sorry, it's my fault![i2t]avatars_view_dead_day_killer_man_phrase_2=How can I redeem myself?[i2t]avatars_view_dead_day_killer_man_phrase_3=I want to help you decorate the graves[i2t]avatars_view_dead_day_killer_man_phrase_4=Take this, adorn their final resting places[i2t]avatars_view_dead_day_killer_man_phrase_5=Sorry for killing you.

具体修复内容如下：
– 购买走私者包时，因操作未正常完成导致包无法收到
– 购买界面在赛季选项卡中打开时，充值货币不显示
– 应用摩托车皮肤导致进入地点时出现问题
另外，挖掘点“回声-1”的围攻机制进行了全面检修，以满足游戏设计团队一开始的要求。玩家反馈上提到数据看起来有点奇怪，事实上也是如此。现在一切都调整正常。至于盲者卡在阿尔法地堡的问题，现在已经是历史了，不过这个可说不准。你知道那个家伙的，对吧。

The collective effort of all the factions is necessary to fend it off.

Screw her, let's go[i2t]story_intro_host_bubble_3=Don't be surprised, but my fest has a special currency. You can get it here.

To be frank[i2t]story_1_2_cultist_bubble_4=What's gonna happen to that non-believing raider?[i2t]story_1_2_cultist_bubble_5=Would you shut up? Or you wanna be put in the cage, too?[i2t]story_1_2_cultist_bubble_6=Hey, who's here?[i2t]story_1_2_cultist_bubble_7=I heard something[i2t]story_1_2_cultist_bubble_8=The prisoners are escaping![i2t]story_1_2_cultist_bubble_9=Hey!

Who sent you?[i2t]story_1_2_julie_bubble_4=Romero wanted to save me but got caught...[i2t]story_1_2_julie_bubble_5=My brothers will never believe me that Romero wanted to help. They think all raiders are the same[i2t]story_2_1_genesis_bubble_1=I have to warn you about two things. First - be careful. There's something wrong with those zombies[i2t]story_2_1_genesis_bubble_2=Second - if you meet Mad Mads, don't be afraid. He's a peaceful guy, just a bit wacky[i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_1=Oh, five, twenty five. Zero, five, two, five. And again![i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_2=We all have our part to play. Don't we? Or am I wrong? No, no, no![i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_3=Peace of mind. A friend of mine. Oh![i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_4=What if he was wrong? What if it's not the last day on Earth? Then what?[i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_5=I should've stayed in the cavern. No one would've guessed. They're gonna find me[i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_6=Oh, Joseph, where are you? How long are you gonna keep us waiting?[i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_7=I'm so sleepy...[i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_8=Why are you following me?[i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_9=Aren't there other things you should be doing?[i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_10=Please, get lost[i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_11=You're just a figment of my imagination![i2t]story_2_1_cultist_bubble_12=You're one of the non-believers, aren't you? Or it's not what you are?[i2t]story_2_1_julie_bubble_1=Hi! I hope you won't tell anyone about us?[i2t]story_2_1_julie_bubble_2=Sometimes it seems to me that Mad Mads is just pretending to be mad[i2t]story_2_1_julie_bubble_3=Don't tell anyone about us, okay? My brothers won't understand[i2t]story_2_1_romeo_bubble_1=Long time no see! Have you managed to find out anything about the goods?[i2t]story_2_1_romeo_bubble_2=Have you already met Mad Mads? He wasn't always like that[i2t]story_2_1_player_bubble_1=Looks like that monster reached Joseph first. So where do we search for the code now?[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_1=Are you coming to the service? Rodrick is going to speak to everyone today[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_2=It's most likely to be the last service on Earth[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_3=Rodrick said you would come back[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_4=There's no evil in our hearts towards you[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_5=We don't believe Joseph. If you meet him, don't trust his words[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_6=Mad Mads left us, and we mourn his lost soul. He used to be different...[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_7=Rodrick was wise enough to kick out those two. I never liked Joseph[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_8=Mads used to always make up funny songs to remember important dates and numbers[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_9=You're not one of them, but I know you. You were sent by raiders. Are you looking for the weapon? It's no use anymore[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_10=This is our last day on Earth. You can take whatever we got here. These things can't change anything[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_11=I will bless you and you will bless me[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_12=We'll go on a one way journey. You and I![i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_13=Yes, Rodrick, my father and brother[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_14=Our celebration is soon to end![i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_15=Death from death, father and brother![i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_16=You served me well[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_17=I'm proud to die with you[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_18=The last day on Earth is coming. Rodrick's prophecy is coming true![i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_19=First, the ark appeared to us, then the girl. Soon the flame will consume the Fire Fest![i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_20=Mad Mads and Joseph didn't believe Rodrick, too. And what's become of them? Where are they now?[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_21=We know you're not alone in here. Don't worry, you don't need protection[i2t]story_2_2_cultist_bubble_22=Come over, I want to tell you something...[i2t]story_2_2_raider_bubble_1=Well, part of the loot is ours, as agreed. Come on, don't be greedy.[i2t]story_2_2_raider_bubble_2=Well that's cool, that looks festival-ish! Now let's get out of here. This place gives me the creeps[i2t]story_3_1_genesis_bubble_1=You were sent by Genesis, right? Max and I are gonna need your help. Just take us to the Bus[i2t]story_3_1_genesis_bubble_2=Someone saw an unusual zombie here recently. Max needs to get the scent... Go, bud![i2t]story_3_1_genesis_bubble_3=It really is an unusual zombie... Judging from the footprints, he moves on all fours[i2t]story_3_1_genesis_bubble_4=Hm, there are someone else's prints, same time frame... Looks like an average-build man[i2t]story_3_1_genesis_bubble_5=More footprints. That's where our hero got caught. Was he eaten?[i2t]story_3_1_genesis_bubble_6=There's no body, he must've been eaten by those bastards. Just like I said. Good job, Max[i2t]story_3_1_genesis_bubble_7=They marked the territory, so all their buddies are coming here. Ugh, those bastards[i2t]story_3_1_genesis_bubble_8=Darn. Their numbers are increasing. We should tell our people that the Fest is getting hotter and hotter. Can you warn them?[i2t]story_3_1_genesis_leader_bubble_1=The last thing I wanted was for the fest to end in a battle with some lopsided bastards…[i2t]story_3_1_genesis_leader_bubble_2=You have my guy with you. Talk to the raiders, the one thing I want even less than the battle now is listening to those morons[i2t]story_3_1_raider_leader_bubble_1=Come on. It might be regular zombies, just… well, ugly. Aren't they all ugly?[i2t]story_3_1_raider_leader_bubble_2=Fine, since we're all in this together now, we won't bail either. Don't worry. You can have our best guy, so be it[i2t]story_3_1_biker_leader_bubble_1=Pfft, the last thing we needed was some sort of a zomboid invasion. And you're like a harbinger of the apocalypse? No offense.[i2t]story_3_1_biker_leader_bubble_2=All right, all right, guess who offered to help. You know her[i2t]story_3_2_genesis_bubble_1=Guys, you'll cover my back, won't you? Guys? Hello![i2t]story_3_2_julie_bubble_1=I'm glad you're here. I have a request. Can you watch Romero?[i2t]story_3_2_romeo_bubble_1=Yeah, now's a bad time to have a crush… And on who? A biker. If anyone told me a month ago, I would spit in their face![i2t]story_3_2_cultist_bubble_1=Joseph! Joseph! I found the code! I know the code to the basement! Joseph?![i2t]story_3_2_genesis_bubble_2=Do you think he was smart enough to write that code down?[i2t]story_3_2_julie_bubble_2=Who's Joseph?[i2t]story_3_2_romeo_bubble_2=I feel sorry for the guy... He was a good driver until he got involved with the cultists...[i2t]story_3_2_genesis_bubble_3=I gather, this is the crate? And that's the reason a horde of those things we saw can come here at any moment?[i2t]story_3_2_julie_bubble_3=I don't think we should put the fate of that crate in the faction leaders' hands. They'll never compromise with each other[i2t]story_3_2_romeo_bubble_3=I think the best thing we can do is take it where it came from. The bus is not far from here[i2t]story_outro_genesis_leader_bubble_1=We were so caught up in competing that we missed the real threat[i2t]story_outro_genesis_leader_bubble_2=I don't care what anybody thinks, Romero and Julie saved us all today[i2t]story_outro_genesis_leader_bubble_3=You do realize they are outcasts now? They will never be able to come back here[i2t]story_outro_raider_leader_bubble_1=Who the hell does that guy think he is? It was our bus! It was supposed to go to us[i2t]story_outro_raider_leader_bubble_2=We almost won! And he decided to drive off with that rosy-cheeked wench. On our bus![i2t]story_outro_biker_leader_bubble_1=I told you we can't trust her! She got involved with that... fop! Romero - what kind of name is that?[i2t]story_outro_biker_leader_bubble_2=She made the right call. There's no place for traitors in our brotherhood. Good riddance, Julie![i2t]birthday_daily_quest_1_2_bubble_1=What do you mean? They've already eaten everything?![i2t]birthday_daily_quest_1_2_bubble_2=Where am I supposed to find this much provision now? Maybe we should cut their portions?[i2t]birthday_daily_quest_1_2_bubble_3=Come on, cool it. My guys will take care of it. Everything's gonna be a-okay![i2t]birthday_daily_quest_1_3_bubble_1=Now we're talking! ..hiccup![i2t]birthday_daily_quest_1_4_bubble_1=I was beginning to think that I'd be sent right to the afterlife[i2t]birthday_farm_event_genesis_npc_phrase_1=You were sent instead of O'Brien? Great! Hope I don't have to explain how the mortar works?[i2t]birthday_farm_event_genesis_npc_phrase_2=Your targets are to the west of here. Just lock onto them and open fire. Try it![i2t]birthday_farm_event_genesis_npc_phrase_3=Ha! Smells like chicken. Now you just need to retrieve the prey. How you do that is not my problem[i2t]birthday_farm_event_genesis_npc_phrase_4=You just came here recently, did you? Hopefully, you'll last longer than O'Brien[i2t]birthday_farm_event_genesis_npc_phrase_5=Hell, I would've died without you![i2t]birthday_farm_event_genesis_npc_phrase_6=I owe you. If you ever need help, let me know. I'll have your back[i2t]birthday_farm_event_genesis_npc_phrase_7=We should check the outpost. There's always a crowd of zombies hanging out there[i2t]birthday_farm_event_biker_npc_phrase_1=Hey, I know you! Julie told me about you. Come over here, I have a job for you[i2t]birthday_farm_event_biker_npc_phrase_2=There's a stash a minute away from here, but it's surrounded by zombies. To clear the way, you're gonna need a mortar, no less[i2t]birthday_farm_event_biker_npc_phrase_3=Really? They trusted you with the mortar? Well, now it's my turn to help you![i2t]birthday_farm_event_biker_npc_phrase_4=Don't go anywhere, I'll be quick![i2t]birthday_farm_event_biker_npc_phrase_5=Julie was looking for you. Don't make her wait, it usually ends poorly[i2t]birthday_farm_event_biker_npc_phrase_6=Here, that's your share. If you ever need help, I'm at your service[i2t]birthday_farm_event_biker_npc_phrase_7=You're going to the watchtowers, too, aren't you? See you there[i2t]birthday_farm_event_biker_npc_phrase_8=But when? My fists haven't been itching like that for a while[i2t]birthday_farm_event_final_npc_phrase_1=Ah, it's you! Just like in my dream... You need to clear this place of zombies. What are you waiting for?[i2t]birthday_farm_event_final_npc_phrase_2=It really is you! And now you'll help me open the treasure chest. You will, won't you?[i2t]birthday_farm_event_final_npc_phrase_3=But I have to warn you, it's very dangerous. In my dream, other people were helping you... Where are they?[i2t]birthday_farm_event_final_npc_phrase_4=Tell me, is it time for you to fulfill your destiny?[i2t]birthday_farm_event_final_npc_phrase_5=Fi Fum Fo Fa[i2t]birthday_farm_event_final_npc_phrase_6=Yes! I opened it! The treasure is ours! Go ahead and take your share[i2t]birthday_farm_event_raider_npc_phrase_1=Stop! Who are you? Are you sure you're not one of those? We don't waste our time with the cultists[i2t]birthday_farm_event_raider_npc_phrase_2=These animals don't accept the truce. You seem to be the real deal. If you need any help, let me know[i2t]birthday_farm_event_raider_npc_phrase_3=Look, that girl was looking for you, what's her name... Julie! That's right[i2t]birthday_farm_event_raider_npc_phrase_4=I'm always willing to shoot some zombies. They are the easiest targets! See you by the watchtowers[i2t]birthday_fetch_water_description=A sip of water - that's all I'm asking for.[i2t]story_2_1_note_head=Note[i2t]story_2_1_note_body=Wait for me by the Bus. We'll end this story. Don't blame it all on yourself, you didn't know what you were transporting. If I don't show up, just open the basement. I hope you remember the code?

荒地迎来了 5 周年！为了庆祝这个日子，存活者们举办了停火节。这样给节日起名是有原因的。众所周知的各个派系——抢劫者、车手和起源——都会参加。各方都不想打斗，因此他们在节庆期间宣布停火。不过，现实并没有这么顺利。
总之，节庆期间会有很多有趣的活动，所以赶快骑车过来看看吧。
交叉口
说到派系和停火，通道地点那里有个东西可能会成为协议破坏的导火索——那是一辆停在峡谷中间的非凡装甲巴士，可能还能开动。各个团伙显然都想把它抢到手，成为末世后最靓的仔。
峡谷中僵尸密布，让人们无法接近巴士，因此各个派系的代表们在附近搭起营地。谁都不愿意公开发起冲突，但是所有人又都想着暗中做点手脚，因此一个圆滑的中间人将会派上用场。去探访各个代表，看看他们想做些什么。任何可能的协助都会获得丰厚的奖励。
技能增加型套装
此次更新将引入一种全新概念——可以使用特殊物品进行升级的套装。升到满级后，即可激活一项技能。当然，不会突然冒出一架便携式直升机，不过我们会考虑的。
第 23 赛季
生日一年只有一次，而赛季则会陆续如期而至，这一点再好不过。除了其他常规活动外，第 23 赛季还有两项新活动，千万不要错过！
Marcy 的礼物
5 月 25 日是我们的生日，当天你会在收件箱中收到一份礼物。这是基于我们的玩家 Marcy 的原画而为所有存活者专门设计的独特礼物。

Shoot![i2t]act_1_trader_phrase_2=Get their attention, I'll get down and help[i2t]act_1_trader_phrase_3=Damn junk, broke down at such a bad time! The engine has to be replaced[i2t]act_1_trader_phrase_4=There must be some valuable cargo dropped off nearby. I've managed to track the signal and I would've already found them if the car didn't die...[i2t]act_1_trader_phrase_5=Look, this one works. Luckily![i2t]act_1_trader_phrase_6=I need more parts though. Bring anything useful you can find in this area, I'll clear out the road[i2t]act_1_trader_phrase_7=Found anything?[i2t]act_1_trader_phrase_8=The signal is lost, but we can track it at Radio Tower. Will you go there while I'm fixing the van?[i2t]act_1_farm_phrase_1=Why'd you feed the farmer to the zombie? Now we'll never know where the crate is... Oh no![i2t]act_1_farm_phrase_2=Holy shit! That beast broke out of the cage! I'm outta here![i2t]act_1_farm_phrase_3=That scumbag screwed me over! Uh... feels like my ribs are all broken...[i2t]act_1_farm_phrase_4=You here for the crate? No matter... It takes a special key to open it... Guess we shouldn't have shot all the farmers... Uhh...[i2t]act_1_pier_phrase_1=Ahoy there! The pier is swarming with the dead! Help me get rid of them, I can't moor![i2t]act_1_pier_phrase_2=Well done! But the light went down - I need to fix it, but I don't want to break the bottom of the boat! Will you help me one more time?[i2t]act_1_pier_phrase_3=Great job for a land dweller! Here's your crate - well-deserved! Why are they even after it?[i2t]act_1_bear_phrase_1=Didn't expect to see a survivor here. My partner should've been back by now, will you help me find him?[i2t]act_1_bear_phrase_4=Hey, can you do me a favor? My weapon is broken and I can't go back empty handed. In return I'll tell you where the hunter is[i2t]act_1_bear_phrase_5=Haven't you got any rawhide yet? I can't return empty-handed![i2t]act_1_bear_phrase_6=I can't thank you enough, I owe you my life![i2t]act_1_bear_phrase_7=Won't tell you where the owner of the backpack is though, cause I don't know. Ciao[i2t]act_1_bear_phrase_9=If it wasn't you, he would've killed somebody else. Thanks for your help![i2t]act_1_store_phrase_1=Shush, stay out of sight. Let's find out what they're up to[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_2=Seems like they're looking for someone or something[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_3=There are many of them,so work quiet, I'll cover your back[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_4=I think we should try to look for the key to the store room behind the counter[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_5=I didn't think I would make it out of here alive, I owe you another one![i2t]act_1_store_phrase_6=Why are they so interested in you?[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_7=No time to explain. We gotta get out of here quickly, I think the explosion's attracted enough unwanted guests[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_8=Clear the road from zombies, that's the only way out[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_9=WIll you help me out one more time? And I'll fix this baby in the meantime[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_10=The sooner we're done, the faster we leave[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_11=Great, let's get out of here[i2t]act_1_store_phrase_12=And what is that noise?[i2t]act_1_wolves_den_phrase_1=Do you copy? An infected animal's been spotted in the area. Get back to the camp while we're thinking how to kill it with the stuff from the crate[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_1=Hey, who's there?[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_2=Good guests are always welcomed by the campfire. Come on, take a sit[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_3=You're just in time for a story[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_4=I'm listening, I'm listening! With half an ear. My backpack ripped off, it used to bring me luck[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_5=Such a nice evening, isn't it? I like to listen to some good stories before going to bed[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_6=Will you sit with us? I'm not going to repeat the story![i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_7=So, I was saying... That night, a woman was heard sobbing in the woods. A shrilling, heartbreaking sob...[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_8=A boy just came back home not knowing anything about the previous night's events. He ran into the woods to help the woman. And vanished without a trace[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_9=Will we eventually find out what happened to him?[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_10=No one will. As the night falls, they say the sound of a woman's sob can still heard in the woods around that village[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_11=The villagers know that, but passers-by occasionally go missing. And then, her sobbing turns into screaming...[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_12=What's up, Rex? Let's go check it out, and you're giving me the creeps at this time of night, dude...[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_13=So, are we good now? How can you all be so timid! This one's not scary at all, let me tell you something even better![i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_14=But first, you'd better throw more wood in the fire. Or you'll turn grey after you hear this one sitting in the dark[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_15=I don't like this kind of stories with no end[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_15_1=Someone whining in the woods, good samaritans ending up God knows where...[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_16=They ran from their wives, and the ladies made up the scary stories[i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_17=Whatta... Ahhh, help, help me![i2t]act_1_night_camp_phrase_18=Hello? Does anyone hear me? There's a huge crate over here, but I can't open it. Can anyone help me? I'm sure there's something valuable inside[i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_1=It's good to see you safe and sound! Help us, we're being attacked by raiders![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_2=I'll get you, bastards![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_3=They're approaching! Get ready! Protect your families![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_4=All right. You give me the crate and we part friends...[i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_5=We don't have any crate! Even if we did, we would never give it to you![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_6=Hey, Boss! Look who we found. This fella was hiding the cargo![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_8=Well, well, well! Okay, buddy, you're going with us. Say 'Goodbye' to your friends who you just saved[i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_9=Hey, you! Hands off from Earl![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_10=Good to see you up and around! But after the raiders attacked, there's real chaos out here, we won't make it without you[i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_11=My dog Dixie was in the dog house when the raiders attacked. Please, bring her to me, while I'm helping Jane![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_12=Dixie is fine and even picked up something from the ground! Thank you so much![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_13=When those bandits broke in, I heard our horses neighing. I have to help my fellow villagers, and you check the stables, please[i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_14=Now it's our horses, we'll build chariots![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_15=I don't know what we would do without you![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_16=I saw old Chuck got cut by one of those morons, but then he hid in his house. Can you go there and check out on him?[i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_17=What... what is it?! Is it my ribs or a broken bottle?![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_18=Just don't fall asleep. Just don't fall asleep. Just... don't...[i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_19=I'm not old enough to die![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_20=All right... I've had worse... Oh come on, who am I lying to?! I haven't![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_21=Oh, you were sent to me from heaven above! Thank you! Thank you![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_22=Am I right thinking that old Chuck's gonna stay with us for longer? Great job, my friend![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_23=I will celebrate this day as my second birthday! For my last couple of years left![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_24=We've cleaned the village from those shits[i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_25=Good job, you've all done very well! Especially you![i2t]act_1_raided_village_1_phrase_26=And now, it's time to take our Earl back home. Arm up, let's kick those raiders out[i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_1=What the hell are you doing here? Get lost[i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_2=Oh, it's you! Why are you standing around doing nothing? Come on, help out[i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_3=I can hear them speaking, we're almost there[i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_4=Look who's here! So you've had the guts to show up right in my hide-out[i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_5=Let our man go and we'll leave, nobody gets hurt[i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_6=Well, I don't think so[i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_7=Leave no one alive[i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_8=Hit them![i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_9=He's trapped, we have to get him out[i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_10=You're not taking me alive![i2t]act_1_junkyard_1_phrase_11=Take him to the village, we'll decide what to do with him there[i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_1=Now I'll make you pay...[i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_2=Keep up the shoveling! Keep digging! Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Come on, move it![i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_3=We have to stop Earl. Go to his place, bring something to remind him about his past![i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_4=Yes, you get it. Talk to Earl, he has to come to his senses![i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_5=Darn it to hell! Yeah, you're right. Even people like that can change. I am the living proof.[i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_6=It's a good thing Earl listened to you! But we still can't just let the thug go. Go get gasoline from the shed. I've got an idea…[i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_7=Do you have the fuel? Let's go to the well, the guys are already there![i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_8=Keep rolling him until he talks![i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_9=Won't he suffocate?[i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_10=I'm not sure if it's more humane...[i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_11=Whose motorcycle is that?[i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_12=You got off easy, scumbag![i2t]act_1_raided_village_2_phrase_13=Stop it! Enough! I'll tell you everything! My guy took the crate to the barn, I'll show you where it is![i2t]act_1_burned_barn_phrase_1=Here's the raider. But where is the crate?[i2t]act_1_burned_barn_phrase_2=I knew... I shouldn't have messed with that... friggin'... crate...[i2t]act_1_burned_barn_phrase_3=You need this bloody cargo? Look for them in the motel. In the base... basement...[i2t]act_1_motel_phrase_1=I'll die in here! You're not just gonna stand and watch, are you?[i2t]act_1_motel_phrase_2=I need help! I'm hurt![i2t]act_1_motel_phrase_3=Ha-ha, I played you! Now I have the strength to bash your head in! That crate will be mine![i2t]act_1_motel_phrase_4=Over! Over! It's Jane! Can anyone hear me?[i2t]act_1_motel_phrase_5=Do you have the crate? Great! Hang on, we're on our way![i2t]act_1_motel_phrase_6=Guys, help the survivor! Get the floater bloater![i2t]act_1_motel_phrase_7=What a day... I'm happy you're okay. Come see me at the gas station, we'll talk about the payment. The tunnel behind us leads there[i2t]act_1_motel_phrase_9=Looks like a regular crate... But it's so heavy![i2t]act_1_motel_phrase_10=Is that what all the fuss was about?[i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_1=The crate is not that easy to open. My guys will take care of it, just look around for now. We've got a lot of interesting stuff in here![i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_2=Make sure to play the slots! You won't be disappointed[i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_3=Five minutes, Jane. And maybe another five after that. We are almost there[i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_4=We don't just let everyone in[i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_5=You're not on the list[i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_6=You need to pay to get inside[i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_7=We're happy to see you![i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_8=Drop the caps in here, pull this lever, and win! Try it, it's all fair![i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_9=If you need someone to fix up the body, we'll be happy to do so. Bring the paint and we'll make it happen![i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_10=When I finish with this beauty, she'll be able to take you anywhere you want! Even to the north to have some pepperoni...[i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_11=If you don't let me in, I'll tear this place to pieces![i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_12=The guys picked the lock, here's your share, take it![i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_13=Key card to Bunker Alfa. That's where they stole the crate from. 
Let's assemble a team and ransack this place! Are you in?[i2t]act_1_gasstation_1_phrase_14=My old friend, a marine, knows some reliable people. We should start with him. I'll show you where he set up camp with his buddies[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_phrase_1=Hey! Hey! Sorry, bud! From a distance, you look just like a zombie! How about we get a drink to hush this out, come![i2t]act_1_trailer_park_phrase_2=What are you standing there for? It's just us here. The booze is on us![i2t]act_1_trailer_park_phrase_3=Wrong pipe... Pour another one![i2t]act_1_trailer_park_phrase_4=You have your eye on the military's treasures in the bunker, too, don't you?[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_phrase_5=Bunker Alfa. I know how to get there and I can take you[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_phrase_6=Told you. There's a buttload of gear and weapons, enough for the whole Crater! But we need a team[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_phrase_7=First, we need a drink. Hey, speedy, can you come get some? It's nearby.[i2t]act_1_convoy_phrase_1=Oh, my head... How much did we drink last night? Where am I? Who am I?[i2t]act_1_convoy_phrase_2=The bottle trail leads here...[i2t]act_1_convoy_phrase_3=Look who's here! Was it your idea to get here on a tractor? We broke the last tractor in the village...[i2t]act_1_convoy_phrase_4=But first, call of nature, and then we head back. You'll be explaining what happened here to Jane[i2t]act_1_raided_village_3_phrase_1=I enjoyed last night, but you should clean up after yourself[i2t]act_1_raided_village_3_phrase_3=As my father used to say, if you start drinking, don't stop. He was so right...[i2t]act_1_raided_village_3_phrase_4=I just want one more bottle, is that too much to ask?[i2t]act_1_raided_village_3_phrase_5=We haven't found Billy, the cook, after yesterday's party[i2t]act_1_raided_village_3_phrase_6=Since you and your friends brought alcohol, you'll be the one who searches for him. Go to his place[i2t]act_1_raided_village_3_phrase_7=That's a sign from the gas station. Oh well[i2t]act_1_gasstation_2_phrase_1=Whoa. I thought you'd never come back here after what happened last night[i2t]act_1_gasstation_2_phrase_2=We are temporarily closed after the last night's... incident[i2t]act_1_gasstation_2_phrase_3=Here you are! You need to fix the mess you made yesterday![i2t]act_1_gasstation_2_phrase_4=Leeroy and a couple of other people went to the Highway yesterday but never came back. Find my guy and bring Leeroy to the Marine![i2t]act_1_bullfarm_2_phrase_1=Out! Get outta here! Horned beast![i2t]act_1_bullfarm_2_phrase_2=You're Taurus, I'm Aries, we're incompatible! Off you go![i2t]act_1_bullfarm_2_phrase_3=I thought he'd give me a ride on his horns! Wait a minute, I'll come right down[i2t]act_1_bullfarm_2_phrase_4=That horned bastard chased me to the roof, and I just came to get some supplies for the trip![i2t]act_1_bullfarm_2_phrase_5=Take me to the camp! It's about time we get into that bunker![i2t]act_1_bullfarm_2_phrase_6=Have you ever fought two floater bloaters at the same time? I have![i2t]act_1_bullfarm_2_phrase_7=I have no idea where the other village guy went. Maybe he disappeared?[i2t]act_1_bullfarm_2_phrase_8=Some beer would be nice...[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_2_phrase_1=About time you showed up! Help the guys with the preparations[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_2_phrase_2=What we're about to see has no comparison. Prove you can handle a weapon or you'll die before you can say "Mommy!"[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_2_phrase_3=Almost ready[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_2_phrase_4=Thanks, I'll get you back for that one. If we make it out alive[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_2_phrase_5=I'm kinda worried, man. Can you get something stronger?[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_2_phrase_6=Just what the doctor ordered[i2t]act_1_trailer_park_2_phrase_7=All the preparations are complete, we can head out[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_1=Now we're all here. Let's start the operation[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_2=I'll give the command as soon as you open the door[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_3=We need the code for the bunker! Do you know it?[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_4=Stay alert, we don't know what we can face this time[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_5=Personally, I'm ready for anything![i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_6=Give me a minute, I'll take care of that thing[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_7=You bring the coupons, you get the reward. I don't know who invented this dispenser, but it's very convenient[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_8=The elevator leads to the next levels[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_9=One of the elders once called this door the corridor of death. I suggest you stay away from the walls[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_10=Are you sure you want to keep going? Personally, I'm sure I don't...[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_11=Watch out, the beasts are just waiting to eat us up[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_12=The only good thing about this is how much useful stuff we can find here...[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_13=There's a bunch of them in here, we should be careful and quiet[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_14=He never finished assembling his ATV...[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_15=He thought he knew how to handle the Big One...[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_16=Careful! This turret will kill you if you don't break it quicker[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_17=Leeroooy[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_18=Lived without fear and died without it[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_19=How long did he last alone?![i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_20=We lost almost everyone, we have to leave[i2t]act_1_bunker_alpha_phrase_21=It all went wrong, we're lucky we survived this mess[i2t]act_1_final_trader_phrase_1=It was nice to fight along with a pro. We work well together, don't we? I'll tell my guys about you, maybe we'll ask for your assistance sometime again[i2t]act_1_final_trader_phrase_2=Oh, here you are! I'm glad you survived. Really![i2t]act_1_final_trader_phrase_3=You played a very important role in my plan[i2t]act_1_final_trader_phrase_4=Yeah, guys, while you were having fun in there, I managed to clean out a couple of raider bases and one military cargo. We'll have enough goods for months![i2t]act_1_final_trader_phrase_5=Thank you, sincerely. I'm sure you got some good stuff in the process, too. I hope we'll work together again[i2t]act_1_radiotower_note_1=This looks like the place. Now we just have to pick up the signal and the crate is ours! But I really don't like that eerie howling, I could hear it as soon as we came here, and that's definitely not a wild animal.[i2t]act_1_radiotower_note_2=Safety measures: before using the generator, make sure that the power is off![i2t]act_1_airdrop_note=The requested object wasn't found at the destination. We advance to the next point, at the following coordinates ...[i2t]act_1_house_note_1=What's with that crate? Everybody's after it. Looks like every local group is involved.[i2t]act_1_house_note_2=Guess I'd better bury it in the backyard for now, and then figure out what I should do next. Keeping it here for too long is dangerous, I'm risking my neck.[i2t]act_1_house_note_3=The object is still not found. We continue further searches. The tracks lead to a nearby river.[i2t]act_1_rivercamp_note_1=Frank, I've carried the crate to the island in the river. Bury it when no one's looking, those idiots are unlikely to look for it there. Or dismantle the crossing, whatever, I don't care. I'll be waiting at...[i2t]act_1_rivercamp_note_2=You're such a dumbass, Frankie. I was kidding about breaking the crossing! Besides, the crate is perfectly noticeable from our shore. I'm going to the farm, gonna try to hold back the raiders, and you, please, fix the damned bridge.[i2t]act_1_wolves_den_note_1=Finally, we've backed that beast into a corner. She's licking her wounds in the cave. She mauled many of ours, but today we're gonna get even with her.[i2t]act_1_wolves_den_note_2=Now we just wait for the right moment and smoke her out of the cave with fire.[i2t]act_1_nightcamp_note=My lucky backpack, saved me so many times, as long as I have it - I'll be alright.[i2t]act_1_contagion_note_1=...Contacts must be closed, and the power cables must be insulated. Insulation tape can be used in the event of damage to the braiding. Be careful and ensure the security of the bracing of the explosive's cables.

Notes in the margin: I brought spare tires, they're in the motorcycle[i2t]act_1_raided_village_note_1=Earl was walking nearby as he was coming back from the hunt when he heard a loud bang in the Grim Forest. There, he found the poor guy and brought him here — looks like the unlucky soul found himself next to the center of the explosion. Fortunately, he has no serious injuries. Just a small concussion. He'll be able to walk once he's had enough rest.
We put all his things next to him, he'll take them when he wakes up.[i2t]act_1_raided_village_note_2=It's sowing season, and Duffy got drunk again and crashed a tractor into a tree. Now we have to find a mechanic who will agree to fix it on the cheap. Maybe we should go to the gas station?

I don't remember seeing you before. And I have a good memory. I've seen a lot in my time. And you know, I think you're a good person. You don't want to disappoint an old man, do you? 

I've been through a lot. I served in the Navy. That's where I met Tucker. When this whole mess started, we put together a gang of our own. He's a great shooter and a very funny guy. He's a lot of fun. I'm something of a leader for our guys. At least they have full trust in me even in the most complicated circumstances. And I, in turn, try to live up to their trust and look after them as much as I can. 

Fate has treated me quite unfairly but I've always rolled with the punches. I know full well that I'm a role model for many of these guys. I can't let them down.</color>[i2t]mercenary_rachel_description=F<color=#FFFFFF80>rankly, I have a problem trusting people. But for some reason, you don't raise any suspicions. You're not one of the bad guys, are you? 

People are usually loud and aggressive. All they do is talk, talk, talk. They get you to trust them and then deceive you. Even though Connor and his gang seem reliable, I'm still not ready to let my guard down. 

I like mechanisms, they never let me down. Take my bike, for example. Yes, it's a bit loud, but it's served me well for six months now. All I have to do is clean it and lubricate its parts. And guess what? It hasn't made a single stupid joke yet. Unlike this clown Tucker.</color>[i2t]mercenary_rust_name=Rust[i2t]mercenary_rust_description=T<color=#FFFFFF80>ry the cocktail, dude. My signature drink! Seven days without sleep after one shot! Do you want some gum? 

Phantoms, dawg. They come at sunrise. Very few see them. But they see everyone! Except for me. Do you know what my secret is? It's the mask. The mask hides my ugliness. Maybe my soul's ugliness? Who knows! Ha, ha! 

So anyway, dude. Phantoms. They know who's been bad. And so do I! The cult followers! They also know that their days are numbered. I am only approaching the inevitable. Simply clearing the world of this filth, dawg. 

I have one more mixture. It makes you nauseous at first, but it'll feel like you're being possessed by a rhino. Don't worry, even my Screwdriver doesn't reject it. If it gets too bad, let me know. I've got something for such an occasion. It raises the dead, I tell you! So, let's just get it down?</color>[i2t]mercenary_tucker_name=Tucker[i2t]mercenary_tucker_description=H<color=#FFFFFF80>ow's it going? Doing okay? Great then! My name's Tucker, I'm Connor's friend since our army days. I'm in charge of good mood in our gang. How's your sense of humor? 

I'm like the sharpest shooter here. For real!  Once, Connor and I went into the yard to practice shooting. After ten shots, the bottle was finally emptied! Ha, ha! Did you get it? 

No, I'm serious. I am the best shooter in the gang. None of them can hit a moving target. They don't understand that first, you need to immobilize the target or at least slow it down, and that makes it much simpler! Ha! You got it, right? 

Have you already met Rachel? She's so quiet, she gives me goosebumps. I once asked her if she was mute or something. Guess what she told me? Nothing! Ha, ha, ha!</color>[i2t]mercenary_liberty_name=Liberty[i2t]mercenary_liberty_description=D<color=#FFFFFF80>o you want to up your game to a whole new level? Leave all your opponents behind with just one blow? I can teach you — it's a total cakewalk! My father once gave me three simple tips. Just follow them, and you'll do great.  

First, relax your shoulders. Take pleasure in playing! It's not a driving exam.

Second, prepare your blow. Put your whole body into it and not just your arms. Even if you keep failing at first, don't worry. Practice will make your swing perfect.  

Third and most importantly, choose the appropriate tool. Planning a precise blow at close range? Then I suggest you take a wedge. Otherwise, choose something made of iron - those things have no equal at medium range. And if your target is far ahead, I suggest you think big and take an Uzi. At the end of the day, it's just a game, and the whole point is to have fun! Am I right? </color>[i2t]mercenary_jack_name=Jack "of all trades"[i2t]mercenary_jack_description=W<color=#FFFFFF80>hen you're holding a hammer, everything around you starts to look like a nail, doesn't it? So, I don't just have the hammer, I also have a chisel, a jigsaw, a saw, and a rotary hammer -- all kinds of stuff in here! What are we gonna do with all that? 

I'm a jack of all trades, I'm just itching to craft something. What do you need? A bench? A chair? Maybe something like the barricades made from barbed wire? Anything you want! I'm not scared of work. It's not a wolf. 

By the way, I once had to fight off a wolf using a construction stapler. There weren't any nails in it, but, as you can see, I still nailed it.</color>[i2t]mercenary_godfrey_name=Godfrey[i2t]mercenary_godfrey_description=S<color=#FFFFFF80>ee these tattoos? These are the spirits of my ancestors. They protect me better than any armor. You don't believe me? Then tell me, why am I still alive?  

I don't feel fear or compassion, all I have inside is fury. I am one with it. It gives me strength. My blood boils when my hatchet cuts through flesh one blow after another. It is only during moments like these I feel truly alive. That's how I'm not like you. You hide behind your armor, stay within firing range. Wimps.

Just like those cult followers that were shooting me in the back when they learned my purpose. All the bullets went right through me. They should've finished me. Cause I'll find them. Each one. They'll answer for everything. Their prophecy will come true, it'll be their last day on Earth.</color>[i2t]mercenary_chris_description=Y<color=#FFFFFF80>es, yes, I used to work for Genesis. I spent seven years in the research center, and for what? So that they would appropriate all of my inventions? 

I was actually the one who invented the dissolver. Genesis made me surrender the patent. They are basically no better than raiders. And I could've become a famous figure in the international community! I would even tell you how it works, but you probably won't get it. 

I headed the department of alternative applications of natural gas research for a few years. A massive amount of work! I would spend nights in the lab. To increase the efficiency, I had to synthesize a special drug that was allowing me to stay focused for hours on end. My hair started falling out and my eyesight started to go because of it. But if you need it, I still have plenty left.</color>[i2t]mercenary_policeman_name=Officer Murphy[i2t]mercenary_policeman_description=I<color=#FFFFFF80>'ve learned my lesson working in the police. I saw it all. And you know what? Most of the time, it's the relatives. People closest to you, and not some butler like it often happens in stupid detective stories. 

In my case, it was my precious wife. She took everything from me. Once I came home after a shift, but instead of a house, I only found ashes. She had burned all my stuff and taken our daughter Casey. And I still don't know why she did that. 

We weren't perfect, we would often fight over nothing. Her temper was no picnic. She collected her things and moved to her parents a few times, and she almost cut me with a kitchen knife during a fight once or twice. Our relationship was irrevocably ruined after she met those weird people... Sometimes, I feel like the only thing that was keeping us together was our daughter. God, I miss her.</color>[i2t]mercenary_hazy_name=Malison[i2t]mercenary_hazy_description=M<color=#FFFFFF80>y mom used to say that I needed to do well at school and excel at everything. I guess you were wrong, mom. Sorry not sorry!

It turned out that to have a sweet life, you just need to be a bad girl in a company of bad guys. The raiders and I were like a pack of wolves. We would take what we wanted and we were a true family for each other. It's a shame we drifted apart... 

You know when I became truly happy? When the guys and I robbed that convoy and I got this machine gun. They say, happiness is a warm gun. So six guns all at the same time is six times the happiness! Bang bang shoot shoot, mom!</color>[i2t]mercenary_karma_name=Karma[i2t]mercenary_karma_description=T<color=#FFFFFF80>o every action, there is a reaction. That principle is the basis for all the sciences: physics, astronomy, chemistry, psychology. Military affairs is no exception. It's a law of nature. They also call it karma in the east.

Karma is a process. It's what you do. My karma is being a perfect warrior. It means that I try to avoid conflicts whenever possible. I prefer saving a life to taking it. But if you're unlucky enough to get in my way, I won't feel sorry for you. You can try to get revenge on me in your next life.  

I studied in the Genesis academy. My sensei taught me everything: martial arts, shooting from all types of weapons, and, most importantly, first aid. I'm a super soldier. I can do it all. 

The only question is what target you're pursuing. Remember about the karma. She's a real bitch.</color>[i2t]mercenary_lemmy_name=Lemmy "Maverick"[i2t]mercenary_lemmy_description=I<color=#FFFFFF80>f you like firearms, I'm your guy. Rifled, smooth-bore - makes no difference for me. 

I enjoy the rhythm, you know? Each weapon has its own. A revolver sounds like a barrel. A burst of automatic rounds sounds like a snare. Roaring turret has a very unique sound - it's my favorite instrument. Our whole gang sounds like a bloody orchestra. 

We're something of a rock band on tour, you feel me? We even have a roadie, Rachel. You'll never see her at our gigs, but this girl's contribution is invaluable. 

Like any musical instrument, a weapon requires care and tuning. I can tune your gun, too.</color>[i2t]ui_main_object_window_specialization=Specializations:[i2t]ui_main_object_window_efficiency=Efficiency:[i2t]ui_main_object_window_rewards=All levels[i2t]ui_storehouse_main_object_dialog_description=You can store everything you need to develop the Settlement here.

凄凉市集活动
我们的兄弟威廉陷入了绝望：《地球末日生存》市集处境堪忧。怎么能置朋友于危机中不顾呢？所以撸起袖子干活吧，把派对带回荒地。作为伸出援手的谢礼，你将获得一个独特的垃圾存放处。另外，还有其他奖励。这些值得你辛苦一场。
Kefir ID 系统大大减轻了技术支持人员的工作压力，让他们能够更加及时地为你的帐户提供紧急帮助。快来创建相关帐户吧。现在注册，还有精彩奖励可以领取。
技术和视觉画面变化
我们一直致力于让大家获得更加舒适和有趣的游戏体验。这一次的变化和改进与游戏的技术部分和特定视觉方面有关，大家会在游戏推进过程中慢慢遇到。例如，我们重新设计了无线电的 UI，现在与无线电的互动体验会舒适得多。[i2t]ui_transport_paints_common=Common[i2t]ui_transport_paints_very_rare=Very rare[i2t]ui_transport_paints_epic=Extremely rare[i2t]patchnotes_1_20_6=[i2fb]无人机及其定制
无人机是荒地中不可或缺的盟友。它在正常运行时，能够射击、爆炸、击晕敌人，甚至还能在战斗过程中给你治疗！为了实现这一切，你需要找到模块的特殊蓝图，并在基地的独特工作台上制作这些模块。所有必要的配方均可在蓝图窗口中找到。新技术，天啊！
在完成第 2 幕后，请务必与定居点的克里斯交谈。
交通枢纽
当你使用无人机前往交通枢纽时，就会立刻了解到它的好处。那里曾经充满生机，如今却空无一人。或者几乎空无一人。但是，这个地点充满了珍贵的战利品，而且到处散落着无人机升级的零件。既然没有人需要它们，那为了存活者的需求而征用它们也算不上犯罪。另外，你在探索这个地方时会找到一些笔记，从而了解大灾难后躲在此地的人的遭遇。
定居点发展
生产在提升。我们就不啰嗦了，这么说吧，新的工作台和资源可以用来升级无人机和发展整个定居点。你会找到越来越多的机遇。还有一个不错的变化是，托盘中的资源现在直接显示在上面。
雇佣兵娜奥米
雇佣兵团队有了新成员。娜奥米跟很多人一样，信任技术多过信任人类。武器、汽车以及现在的无人机如果出现问题，只会源于纯粹的技术原因。没有声名狼藉的人类因素。而重视耐久度且能够使用废料制作无人机的同伴会成为你的团队的一大助力。
体验优化
改善已有体验是一项重要性不亚于创造新事物的任务。我们调整和改进了枪匠工作台：现在你可以一键应用物品栏中所有已保存的武器配置！探险模式、指挥中心以及定居点中的营房也进行了玩法和视觉改动。另外，特定的高需求资源现在可在新的地点中找到。[i2t]battler_object_spore_name=Infection Sprayer[i2t]battler_object_spore_description=Damages 1% of a mercenary's health every 5 sec.
